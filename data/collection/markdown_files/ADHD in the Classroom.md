# ****ADHD**** in the ****Classroom****: Helping Children Succeed in ****School****

# At a Glance

1. Children with **attention**-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (****ADHD****) experience more obstacles in their path to success than the average student.

2. Teachers and parents can **help** children with ****ADHD**** do well in school.

# What to know

To meet the needs of children with ****ADHD****, schools may offer:

1. ****ADHD**** treatments, such as behavioral classroom management or organizational training;

2. Special education services;

3. Accommodations to lessen the effect of ****ADHD**** on their learning.

# Behavioral classroom management

The behavioral classroom management approach encourages a student's positive behaviors in the classroom, through a reward system or a daily report card, and discourages their negative

behaviors. This teacher-led approach has been shown to influence student behavior in a constructive manner, increasing academic engagement. Although tested mostly in elementary schools,

behavioral classroom management has been shown to work for students of all ages.

# Organizational training

Organizational training teaches children time management, planning skills, and ways to keep school materials organized in order to optimize student learning and reduce distractions. This

management strategy has been tested with children and adolescents.

# Accommodations

IEPs and 504 Plans can offer accommodations for students to **help** them manage their ****ADHD****, including the following:

1. Extra time on tests

2. ****Instruction**** and assignments tailored to the child

3. Positive reinforcement and feedback

4. Using technology to assist with tasks

5. Allowing breaks or time to move around

6. Changes to the ****environment**** to limit distraction

7. Extra **help** with staying organized

# What teachers and school administrators can do to **help**

For teachers, helping children manage their ****ADHD**** symptoms can present a challenge. Most children with ****ADHD**** are not enrolled in special education classes but do need extra assistance on 

a daily basis.

# Helping students with ****ADHD****

Positive discipline practices at school can **help** make school routines more predictable and achievable for children. Children with ****ADHD**** benefit when schools use positive rather than punitive

disciplinary strategies.

# ****Communication****

1. Give frequent feedback and **attention** to positive behavior.

2. Be sensitive to the influence of ****ADHD**** on emotions, such as self-esteem issues or difficulty regulating feelings.

3. Provide extra warnings before transitions and changes in routines.

4. Understand that children with ****ADHD**** may become deeply absorbed in activities that interest them (hyper-focus) and may need extra assistance shifting their **attention**.

# Assignments and tasks

1. Make assignments clear—check with the student to see if they understand what they need to do.

2. Provide choices to show mastery (for example, let the student choose among written essay, oral report, online quiz, or hands-on project.

3. Make sure assignments are not long and repetitive. Shorter assignments that provide a little challenge without being too hard may work well.

4. Allow breaks—for children with ****ADHD****, paying **attention** takes extra effort and can be very tiring.

5. Allow time to move and exercise.

6. Minimize distractions in the classroom.

7. Use organizational tools, such as a homework folder, to limit the number of things the child has to track.

# Develop a plan that fits the child

1. Observe and talk with the student about what helps or distracts them (for example, fidget tools, limiting eye contact when listening, background music, or moving while learning can be beneficial or distracting, depending on the child).

2. Communicate with parents on a regular basis.

3. Involve the school counselor or psychologist

# Dealing with disruptive classroom behavior

To head off behavior that takes time from other students, work out a couple of warning signals with the student who has ****ADHD****. This can be a hand signal, an unobtrusive shoulder squeeze, or a

sticky note on the student’s desk. If you have to discuss the student’s behavior, do so in private. And try to ignore mildly inappropriate behavior if it’s unintentional and isn’t distracting

other students or disrupting the ****lesson****.

# Information delivery

Give instructions one at a time and repeat as necessary.

If possible, work on the most difficult material early in the day.

Use visuals: charts, pictures, color coding.

Create outlines for note-taking that organize the information as you deliver it.

# ****Teaching**** techniques for students with ****ADHD****

****Teaching**** techniques that **help** students with ****ADHD**** focus and maintain their concentration on your ****lesson**** and their work can be beneficial to the entire class.

# Starting a ****lesson****

1. Signal the start of a ****lesson**** with an aural cue, such as an egg timer, a cowbell or a horn. (You can use subsequent cues to show how much time remains in a ****lesson****.)

2. Establish eye contact with any student who has ****ADHD****.

3. List the activities of the ****lesson**** on the board.

4. In opening the ****lesson****, tell students what they’re going to learn and what your expectations are. Tell students exactly what materials they’ll need.

# Conducting the ****lesson****

1. Keep instructions simple and structured. Use props, charts, and other visual aids.

2. Vary the pace and include different kinds of activities. Many students with ****ADHD**** do well with competitive games or other activities that are rapid and intense.

3. Have an unobtrusive cue set up with the student who has ****ADHD****, such as a touch on the shoulder or placing a sticky note on the student’s desk, to remind the student to stay on task.

# Ending the ****lesson****

1. Summarize key points.

2. If you give an assignment, have three different students repeat it, then have the class say it in unison, and put it on the board.

3. Be specific about what to take home.
