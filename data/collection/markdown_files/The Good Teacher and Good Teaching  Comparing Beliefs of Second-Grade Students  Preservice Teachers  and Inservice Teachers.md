# The Good ****Teacher**** and Good ****Teaching****: Comparing Beliefs of Second-Grade Students, Preservice Teachers, and Inservice Teachers

# Abstract

Most teacher educators would agree that one of the primary goals of a

teacher preparation program is to teach individuals how to become good teachers. What is open to debate is exactly what characteristics define good teachers. Although

there is a vast literature on good teaching, few studies have compared the beliefs of individuals at various educational levels using a variety of investigative techniques.

The purpose of this study was to explore second-grade students’, preservice teach- ers’, and inservice teachers’ beliefs about good teachers and good teaching by using

a combination of survey, drawing, and interview tasks. Results indicated that beliefs about good teaching seem to be formed at an early age with clear distinctions

between second-grade students and inservice teachers. By comparison, the preser- vice teachers seemed to possess beliefs that mirrored both the second graders and

inservice teachers. Implications for research, teaching, and teacher education are discussed.

Key words: student beliefs, teacher beliefs, teacher education, teacher knowledge, teaching

Whether educational researcher or everyday citizen, most individuals have had some exposure to schools and teachers, and as a result of that exposure almost

everyone has some conception of the good teacher or good teaching. Indeed, for over a century, educational philosophers such as William James and John Dewey

have attempted to expound on the art and science of good teaching. James (1977) often suggested that both the art and science of teaching involved tapping a stu-

dents’ interest: In teaching, you must simply work your pupil into such a state of interest in what

you are going to teach him that every other object of **attention** is banished from his mind; then reveal it to him so impressively that he will remember the occasion to his

dying day; and finally fill him with devouring curiosity to know what the next steps in the subject are. (pp. 24–25)

Like educational philosophers, educational researchers have also pined over the mysteries of good teachers and good teaching. From the early 1900s, when

many scholars concluded that good teaching equaled student learning, to the fourth edition of the Handbook of Research on ****Teaching**** (Richardson, 2001),

efforts have yielded a plethora of research aimed at providing insight about good teaching for teachers, teacher educators, and policy makers.

Recently, the important role of teachers’ beliefs about teaching and learning has become more evident (e.g., Chambliss & Garner, 1996; Murphy, 2000). As

Pajares (1992) suggested, one difficulty in exploring and investigating teacher beliefs lies in the multitude of definitions of beliefs. Since the days of the ancient

Greek philosophers (e.g., Plato), defining beliefs has been a challenge. Seeming- ly, the most substantive obstacle has been differentiating beliefs from knowledge

(e.g., Alexander, Murphy, Guan, & Murphy, 1998). Woolfolk-Hoy and Murphy (2001) suggested that the learning literature most often describes knowledge as

“one’s idiosyncratic reserve of skills, information, experiences, beliefs, and memories” (p. 2). Such a definition suggests that one’s beliefs are subsumed by

knowledge (Alexander & Murphy, 1998; Nisbett & Ross, 1980). As Richardson (1996) explained, knowledge must have evidence to back up the claim, and

beliefs are thought to be true without the necessity of evidence. Pajares (1992), in his comprehensive review of teacher beliefs, suggested that

the most common distinction between belief and knowledge is that beliefs are based on judgment and evaluation, whereas knowledge pertains to objective, ver-

ifiable fact. Although it is not the purpose of this study to settle the longstanding debate over these terms, we thought it necessary to explain our own stance. For

the purposes of this study, we have conceptualized beliefs and knowledge as overlapping constructs, where beliefs are thought to be true without the necessi-

ty of evidence and knowledge requires evidence to support a given claim (e.g., Richardson, 1996). We have employed these definitions based on several studies

that have identified similar concepts by a majority of preservice and practicing teachers and students (e.g., Alexander & Dochy, 1995; Alexander, Murphy, &

Woods, 1996).

# ****Teacher**** Beliefs

The teacher belief literature suggests that beliefs are acquired as a result of the variety of experiences one is afforded. For example, Bird, Anderson, Sullivan,

and Swindler (1992) investigated the beliefs of preservice teachers using an introductory education course in which preexisting beliefs about teaching and

learning were discussed and challenged. “The course was designed to bring to the surface and challenge ideas that many of them held about teaching, learning,

schooling, and learning to teach” (Bird et al., p. 3). Among other conclusions, Bird et al. found that preservice teachers’ beliefs were deeply rooted in their indi-

vidual experiences. Richardson (1996) categorized such experiences into three areas: personal experience, experience with school, and experience with formal

knowledge. Further, she suggested that all three of these areas have the potential to influence and shape an individual’s beliefs about teaching. As a case in point,

Calderhead and Robson (1991) reported that preservice teachers remembered vivid images of teaching from their past experiences as students. Specifically,

these researchers illustrated that the influence of one’s personal and school expe- riences has the power to affect the decisions preservice teachers would make as

teachers. Along these lines, Gupta and Saravanan (1995) concluded that those preservice teachers with negative memories of schooling were more willing to

try new techniques than their peers with positive memories of **instruction**. Personal experience also influences practicing professionals. In a qualitative

study, Kane and Temple (1997) examined reflective essays written by school prin- cipals and teachers. The essays focused on the participants’ vision of an effective

faculty member. Each group read the essays that corresponded to their respective positions and responded to the descriptions of effectiveness. The researchers con-

cluded that the ideal vision of each position was different according to personal experience. The analysis also revealed that teachers and principals idealize their

jobs. Frequently mentioned characteristics of a good educator included elements of character, skills, mastery of discipline, professional growth, commitment to

mission, contrasting perspectives, diversity, the “all around” teacher, the enormi- ty of the task, and the definition of professional characteristics.

Another consistent finding within the teacher belief literature is that the degree to which teachers cling to their beliefs is linked to how early the beliefs were

formed. “The earlier a belief is incorporated into the belief structure, the more difficult it is to alter . . .” (Pajares, 1992, p. 317). For example, an otherwise com-

petent student who generally performed poorly on standardized tests might form the belief that standardized tests are poor measures of achievement. Similarly,

Nisbett and Ross (1980) suggested that early experiences strongly influence per- sonally held convictions. The earlier and more profound the experience, the more

difficult it is to modify, suggesting that individuals could begin to form beliefs about good teaching even prior to entering school. Therefore, beliefs appear to

be highly resistant to change. As such, one might surmise that beliefs about teaching are not only well established by the time students enter a training pro-

gram but also that students may hold onto those beliefs in the face of contradic- tory evidence (Buchmann, 1987; Raymond & Santos, 1995; Wilson, 1990).

Arguably, one of the primary goals of teacher education programs is to mold students into good teachers through the teaching of new or refined pedagogical

knowledge. One difficulty, however, is that many students come to teacher train- ing programs with preconceived beliefs about the characteristics of good teach-

ers (Lortie, 1975). As Pajares (1992) suggested, preservice teachers are “insid- ers.” That is, they have observed teaching in action for at least 12 years and have

developed their own sense of what makes a teacher effective. Further, preservice teachers’sense of good teaching is often defined by their narrow classroom expe-

riences rather than research outcomes (e.g., Woolfolk-Hoy & Murphy, 2001). Essentially, students generate or reify their beliefs about pedagogy and, as a

result, fail to glean additional pedagogical knowledge. Although it seems intu- itive to accept the presuppositions offered by Pajares, Lortie, and other

researchers, the fact remains that educational researchers know very little about the development of pedagogical beliefs.

Finally, efforts made to change preservice teachers’ deeply held beliefs have had mixed results. In fact, research is inconclusive about whether the teacher

education program experience alters beliefs (e.g., Brookhart & Freeman, 1992). Several studies have indicated that student teaching does not influence signifi-

cantly the student teacher’s perception of teaching (e.g., Kalaian & Freeman, 1989; McDiarmid, 1990). For example, McDiarmid found that, throughout train-

ing, preservice teachers resisted changing their initial belief that young children could not comprehend complicated ideas. Tabachnick and Zeichner (1984) con-

cluded that the student teaching experience did not alter preservice teacher’s con- cepts of good teaching; it only strengthened their preexisting philosophies. This

may be because the theories taught in class are not seen as applicable; preservice teachers believe that the theories do not transfer to the student teaching experi-

ence (Wubbels, 1992). In contrast, some studies indicate that changes in beliefs about teaching do occur during teacher training (Jacobs, 1968; Skipper &

Quantz, 1987). Jacobs reported that preservice teachers entered teacher educa- tion programs with very rigid views of education, but by the end of student teach-

ing, their perspectives included more open and democratic ideas about education. What is even more interesting, however, is that individuals, at all educational lev-

els (e.g., middle school, high school, preservice teachers, or teachers), have over- whelmingly suggested that beliefs are modifiable (Alexander et al., 1998;

Alexander et al., 1996).

# Characteristics of Good ****Teaching****

There is a plethora of research examining teacher knowledge and its role in expert teaching (e.g., Clermont, Borko, & Krajcik, 1994; McEwan & Bull, 1991;

Shulman, 2000). Certainly, Shulman’s work in this area has received much atten- tion. In the late 1980s (e.g., 1986, 1987), Shulman argued that, to be effective,

teachers must possess and exhibit competency in **content** knowledge, pedagogi- cal knowledge, and pedagogical **content** knowledge. According to Shulman, con-

tent knowledge refers to an understanding of the concepts and underlying struc- ture of the concepts being taught, whereas pedagogical knowledge includes the

skills necessary for guiding, managing, assessing, and communicating with stu- dents. By comparison, pedagogical **content** knowledge refers to the ability to

convey **content** knowledge through multiple models of teaching to enhance stu- dent understanding, comprehension, and achievement (Hogan, Rabinowitz, &

Craven, in press). Over the past decade, many researchers have employed Shul- man’s framework as a mechanism for examining differences between expert and

novice teachers (e.g., Hogan et al.). In the present study, however, we were inter- ested in assessing individuals’ beliefs (i.e., notions not necessarily based on evi-

dence) about good teaching. Given that the vast literature on beliefs suggests that beliefs are based primar-

ily on experiences, one might assume that students begin to form beliefs about good teaching as soon as they begin school (e.g., Lortie, 1975; Parjares, 1992).

Unlike the premedical or the prelaw student, the preservice teacher occupies a unique position. Having already been a student for many years, the preservice

education student likely has developed some well-established beliefs about good (or effective) teaching even though she has had little actual teaching experience.

Marso and Pigge (1989) concluded that most students who enter teacher educa- tion programs do so with a positive general disposition toward teaching. Howev-

er, Weinstein (1988) found that preservice teachers also display “unrealistic opti- mism”—the tendency to believe that problems experienced by others will not be

experienced by them. In a separate study (Weinstein, 1989), preservice teachers completed a ques-

tionnaire consisting of both open-ended and fixed-response questions. These col- lege students were asked to describe what they meant by “a really good teacher.”

Their responses were coded, which resulted in 30 categories (e.g., caring, fair- ness, intelligence, openness, or respect). The top five characteristics of a really

good teacher were caring/understanding/warm/friendly, ability to relate to chil- dren, patience, ability to motivate students, and ability to maintain discipline.

Book, Byers, and Freeman (1983) used a questionnaire that asked preservice teachers to identify the most important goal of teaching, among other things. Pre-

service teachers chose, “To work with students in a way that will **help** them address their personal concerns and develop healthy self-concepts” (p. 11).

The overarching characteristics identified by all of the previously mentioned studies include the value of interpersonal aspects of teaching rather than the aca-

demic goals of schooling. Although many research studies have yielded similar findings, Strickland, Page, and Page (1986) found that preservice teachers con-

sistently rated several qualities of good teachers higher than other characteristics. Among those characteristics rated highly were explains subjects clearly, enjoys

teaching, and is knowledgeable in subjects taught. These characteristics center on the cognitive/academic variables.

In contrast to the literature on pedagogical beliefs held by inservice or preser- vice teachers, the research on primary grade students’ beliefs about good teach-

ing appears to be limited. Rather than beliefs about good teaching, it would appear that primary-aged elementary students were asked more often to discern

teaching competencies (e.g., Vollmer & Creek, 1988). Although related to beliefs, these studies do not indicate a complete picture of what primary grade

students believe to be good teaching. However, the results of two studies illustrated interesting results about the per-

ceptions of young children concerning teaching. Vollmer and Creek (1988) examined student perceptions regarding teaching competencies of both master

teachers and preservice teachers. Two primary classrooms (first- and second- grade students) assessed teacher competencies in classroom procedures and

interpersonal skills. Results of the study revealed that the primary grade students did not discern differences between the preservice and the master teachers.

“Although the hierarchy of teaching expertise may be perceived by the teachers themselves and by the parents of the children, there is little information available

that reveals the ability of young children to discern the variance in the compe- tencies of their teachers” (p. 4). Similar outcomes were reported in a second

study conducted by Vollmer, Creek, and Vollmer (1990). Students from kinder- garten through eighth grade were unable to differentiate reliably the competen-

cies of the master teacher from the preservice teacher. The fact that these young students were unable to discern between the competencies of preservice teachers

and masters, however, does not preclude them from possessing beliefs about the characteristics of a good teacher and good teaching.

Recent research concerning students’ beliefs about good teaching has suggest- ed that teachers continue to be the determining factor in how much students learn

and achieve (e.g., Corbett & Wilson, 2002; McIntyre & Battle, 1998; Thomas, 1998). Independent of student characteristics (e.g., age, gender, or ethnicity) or

the nature of the classroom (e.g., regular education or those structured for stu- dents with emotional or behavioral disorders), students seemed to share percep-

tions about good teachers and good teaching. Specifically, good teachers possess and exhibit a number of defining characteristics: They have control over the

classroom, they do not have to yell, and they are fair. In addition, good teachers **help** students and are **kind** and respectful. Finally, good teachers take the time to

get to know their students and their circumstances, and they treat students with respect.

Although those more recent studies have extended our understanding about requisite classroom competencies, we still know very little about very young stu-

dents’ beliefs about good teachers and good teaching. Moreover, few, if any, researchers have compared young students’ perception with those of preservice

and inservice teachers. Finally, as suggested by Brookhart and Freeman (1992), research on preservice teachers’ beliefs has been characterized by some limita-

tions, including a dependency on survey methodology and a failure to consider differences among the preservice and inservice teachers. As such, the overarch-

ing purpose of this study was to examine the degree of similarity of beliefs about good teaching among second graders, preservice teachers, and inservice teach-

ers. By collecting complementary forms of data (i.e., survey data, drawings, and open-ended questions), and by including individuals at various educational lev-

els, we hoped to circumvent some of the limitations of the current literature. Given that teachers’ beliefs appear to influence their perceptions about students,

as well as how and what they choose to teach (Fennema, Peterson, Carpenter, & Lubinski, 1990; Bennett, Gottesman, Rock, & Cerullo, 1993), it seems impera-

tive that the teacher research field gain a firmer understanding of teachers’ beliefs.

# Method

# Participants

Three groups (second graders, preservice teachers, and inservice teachers) of participants took part in this investigation. Respondents in Group 1 were 60 sec-

ond-grade students ranging in age from 7 to 9 years. These participants (32 girls and 28 boys) attended one of three second-grade classrooms in a public, subur-

ban, elementary school in the Midwest. The ethnic breakdown of the primary stu- dents was representative of the neighborhoods surrounding the school (95% Cau-

casian and 5% African American). Group 2 participants consisted of 61 preservice teachers (50 women and 11

men) enrolled in a master’s level, teacher preparation program at a large, land grant university in the Midwest. The average age of Group 2 was approximately

27 years, and all but 2 students were being trained as primary education teachers. The remaining students were being trained to teach lower level middle school. The

ethnic breakdown of the preservice teachers was representative of the teacher pop- ulation in which they will likely be employed (71% Caucasian, 13% African

American, 2% Asian, and 2% mixed). The majority (96%) of these students had attended suburban elementary, middle, and high schools as students, and approx-

imately 70% were completing year-long internships in suburban settings. Twenty-two inservice teachers (Group 3) also participated in the study. Group

3 comprised 19 women and 3 men who were employed at both urban (40%) and suburban (60%) schools in the Midwest. The average age for Group 3 was

approximately 38, and they averaged 15 years of teaching experience. All but 2 of these individuals were teaching primary grades, although many had taught in

middle schools. Although the ethnic breakdown of this group did not approxi- mate their respective student populations in all cases, it was representative of the

greater metropolitan area in which they resided (90% Caucasian and 10% African American).

All of the participant groups attended, interned, or taught in one of the profes- sional development schools associated with the aforementioned university in

which the preservice teachers were enrolled. The teacher preparation program is designed so that preservice teachers spend consistent time throughout a school

year interning with a mentor teacher. As such, the inservice teachers were repre- sentative of a subsample of the mentor teacher group. We chose to use this small-

er sample of inservice teachers to avoid a one-to-one mentor-to-intern correla- tion. By doing so, we hoped to control for intern bias due to mentor teacher

exposure. We also hoped to reduce any bias by assessing preservice teachers’ beliefs at the beginning of their preparation program.

# Measures

Good teacher measure. To measure participants’ beliefs about effective teaching,

we used an adapted version of the Tuckman ****Teacher**** Feedback Form—****Student**** Edition (Tuckman, 1995). We chose this measure for two reasons. First, the

Tuckman measure uses commonly understood terms to describe teacher behav- iors and characteristics (e.g., caring or boring), and this was important so that our

second-grade students would understand the concepts. Second, the Tuckman measure includes constructs that seem more belief- or perceptual-based (e.g.,

strict) than those offered by other researchers (e.g., Shulman, 1987). Specifical- ly, the Tuckman measure consists of a list of teacher characteristics, and students

are asked to rate the extent to which a particular characteristic contributes to good teaching. Because we wanted to use this measure with second graders, we

deleted any characteristics that we judged were beyond the students’ understand- ing. Our judgments were based on our understanding of child development as

well as the second author’s years of primary grade teaching experience. In addi- tion to selecting a subsample of characteristics, we also modified the 4-point Lik-

ert rating scale to a graded series of smiley faces. The participating children had used similar smiley faces in their everyday work and understood the meaning of

the 4 different faces. The students were instructed to “Circle the face that you feel best describes a good teacher.”

The preservice teachers completed this measure at the beginning of their train- ing program, and the inservice teachers completed the same measure within the

first month of school. The version administered to the preservice and inservice teachers employed a 4-point Likert scale ranging from always important (1) to

never important (4). The Cronbach alpha reliabilities for this measure were determined individually by group for comparison purposes. Group 1 had the low-

est reliability (α = .55), whereas Groups 2 and 3 had similar reliability outcomes (α = .83 and α = 87, respectively). The low reliability for Group 1 was due, in

part, to low variation in the students’ responses. Drawing the good teacher and classroom. All groups were asked to draw a pic-

ture of good teaching. Drawings were chosen as one method of collecting the stu- dents’ beliefs about good teachers and good teaching. As Burns and Kaufman

(1970) explained, “Young children usually express themselves more naturally and spontaneously through actions rather than through words” (p. 10). Burns and

Kaufman also suggested that drawings provide an excellent method of exploring the world of the child, they are simple to administer, nonthreatening, and can be

used where other techniques are limited. In the present research, we adapted the Kinetic ****School**** Drawing (KSD) instrument, which has been suggested to have

numerous research possibilities that contribute to understanding the dynamics and factors related to self-growth (Burns, 1982). This measure is usually admin-

istered as a projective technique investigating the child’s perceptions of the teacher and of his/her peers and peer relationships. The KSD may also be used

with classroom groups, as it was for our purposes, to obtain data on students’per- ceptions of teachers and classroom environments (Knoff & Prout, 1985a, 1985b).

In essence, when a participant is told to “Draw your classroom with the teacher and students doing something,” the participant’s subjective school experience is

graphically presented (Kaufman & Wohl, 1992). In the present investigation, all respondents were given the same instructions.

Each participant was given a sheet of paper and a pencil and asked to draw a school picture that included a good teacher in a classroom with a few students,

all doing something. The evaluation of the drawings was a multistep process in which we looked at both the whole picture and the particulars of each drawing;

the process was completed in much the same way one would conduct a key word and **content** analysis of a verbal response. The first step was to evaluate respon-

dents’ whole pictures. Based on the evaluation procedure for the KSD (Kaufman & Wohl, 1992), we attended to student proportion, perspective, and method of

**instruction** (e.g., size and placement of figures or whole group vs. small group). We also noted any omissions, inclusions, and erasures that were unique to a par-

ticular drawing. In completing this broad whole picture evaluation, we were guided by Di Leo (1970), who suggested that drawing is not a test of mental abil-

ity, although a complete figure drawing tends to be predominately intellectual. Thus, in this case, a drawing of people doing something together in a classroom

is highly colored by the child’s feelings; as a result, the response is predomi- nately emotional. Essentially, participants are telling us how they feel about

themselves and their **environment** and less about what they know. We were also interested in the particulars of each drawing. To evaluate the par-

ticulars of the drawings, we circled all of the salient attributes of the pictures (e.g., math problems on the board, teacher sitting, or two girls at desks). Both the first

and second author coded the attributes of the pictures (interrater agreement = 92%). The next step was to make a comprehensive list of all of the salient attrib-

utes and note the number of times they appeared for each group. We then looked for themes in the attributes and, where possible, combined individual attributes

into overarching categories. For example, many pictures were of specific **content** being taught (e.g., math or reading), so we made an overarching category labeled

“**content** area.” Similarly, we placed clocks, calendars, and chalkboards in a cate- gory called “classroom décor/supplies.” (A comprehensive list of these salient

attributes and categories appears in Table 2.) When necessary, respondents’ com- ments were used as a source of cross-validation for the drawings.

Like Kaufman and Wohl (1992), we also included a brief postdrawing inter- view to address questions, confirm interpretations, and gain further information.

To analyze these responses, we performed a key word and **content** analyses. Essentially, we were looking for evidence of classroom dynamics, interactions

between teachers and students, and the types of activities that the various respon- dent groups associate with good teaching. The responses were scored by the sec-

ond author, and the first author independently scored a random selection of 10% of the responses (interrater agreement = 96%). Disagreements were discussed

and charted after consensus.

# Results

# Good ****Teacher**** Characteristics

Our first step in analyzing the respondents’ beliefs about the characteristics of

good teachers was to explore the descriptive data. Means and standard deviations across the three groups as well as by individual group are listed in Table 1. Over-

all, we found that our respondents found almost all of the listed characteristics to be important for good teaching. Specifically, these data revealed that good teach-

ers are caring, patient, not boring, polite, and organized. ****The data**** also revealed that being softspoken, ordinary, or strict are relatively less important characteris-

tics of good teachers. When we analyzed the data for the individual groups, we found a high degree of similarity across the participants’ espoused beliefs.

Essentially, every group believed good teachers needed to be caring. In addi- tion, all three groups appeared to be in agreement concerning the importance of

teachers being not boring and polite. The preservice teachers and the inservice teachers also agreed that good teachers should be patient. In contrast, the second-

grade students ranked patience as the fifth most important characteristic of good teachers. ****The data**** also revealed that both the preservice teachers and the inser-

vice teachers believed that being ordinary was the least important characteristic of a good teacher.

To explore the differences among the group means for the various characteris- tics, we also conducted a one-way analysis of variance (ANOVA) with good

teaching (i.e., a composite score of the individual characteristics) as the depen- dent variable and group (i.e., second graders, preservice teachers, and inservice

teachers) as the between-subjects variable. ****The data**** suggest a significant mean difference between the groups, F(2, 140) = 4.94, p = .008, MSE = 18.27. For post

hoc analysis, we employed Fisher’s Least Significant Difference test, because it has been found to be most robust in differentiating between three groups. The

post hoc test revealed that the composite beliefs of the second graders (M = 18.25, SD = 3.36) were significantly lower than both the preservice (M = 20.34,

SD = 4.63) and inservice teachers (M = 20.91, SD = 5.37). We also conducted one-way ANOVAs using each characteristic as a dependent

variable and the three groups as the between-subjects variable. To control for a family-wise, Type I error, we used a Bonferroni adjustment to establish a mean-

ingful p value for the 12 ANOVAs. Essentially, we ran these additional analyses

to locate the source of difference between the three groups. These analyses revealed that the source of difference was attributable to significant mean differ-

ences, F(2, 140) ≥6.48, p ≤.002, MSE ≤.85, for 4 characteristics (i.e., likeable, shy, ordinary, and strict). Post hoc difference tests revealed that the second

graders believed that likeable, shy, and ordinary were more important character- istics than either the preservice teachers or inservice teachers. Not surprisingly,

the second graders also believed that is it was far less important to be strict than the preservice or inservice teachers.

Finally, we were also interested in the ranked importance of the characteris- tics. To determine this, we rank ordered the characteristics for each group using

the means reported in Table 1. We found that the second graders and the preser- vice teachers ranked four characteristics the same (i.e., organized, unclear, shy,

and softspoken). Similarly, we also found that the preservice teachers and the inservice teachers also ranked four characteristics the same (i.e., patient, boring,

polite, and ordinary). The only ranking agreement across all three groups, how- ever, was for caring. We believe that this finding suggests a developmental trend

among the data. That is, as individuals progress through school, they gradually acquire similar beliefs about the characteristics of good teachers.

Drawing the Good ****Teacher**** and ****Classroom**** In addition to having respondents rate the importance of particular character-

istics, we also had them draw pictures that illustrated their beliefs about the good teacher and classroom. By having the participants draw, we felt that we would

have a more systemic understanding of the participants’ beliefs about the good teacher and classroom in situ. Based on previous work done with kinetic draw-

ings, we looked at two broad aspects of the pictures. We refer to these two broad aspects as the whole picture and picture particulars.

Whole picture. In trying to understand participants’ whole pictures, we charted teacher-to-student proportion, perspective, and **instruction**. Interestingly, we

found that the majority of second graders (60%) and preservice teachers (72%) drew the teacher as much larger than the students, suggesting that the taller fig-

ure, the teacher, has power over the smaller drawn figures, the students. By com- parison, the majority of inservice teachers drew classrooms in which teachers

and students were more evenly proportioned, as they would be in real life. It may be that these inservice teachers are more comfortable with a reciprocal relation-

ship with their students due to their years of experience. When evaluating the respondents’ pictures, we also looked at perspective, that

is, from what perspective individuals drew their classrooms. If the classroom was drawn as though the person was looking down on the classroom from above (Fig-

ure 1), we called it a “bird’s eye perspective.” If the classroom was drawn at eye level as though the person was looking straight ahead, we referred to that as

“straight on.” We found that the majority of second graders (80%) drew their pic- tures straight on, whereas the majority of preservice and inservice teachers drew

their pictures from a bird’s eye perspective. It would seem that both groups of teachers have a more global perspective of the classroom, whereas the students

have a more narrow view (Kaufman & Wohl, 1992). The students’ more narrow view of the room may be attributable to actual biological size or cognitive ability.

When evaluating the pictures, we noticed that a number of the participants drew classrooms that were outdoors. Specifically, 5% of preservice teachers and

5% of inservice teachers drew classrooms outside (Figure 2). The fact that most participants drew indoor classrooms seems to reinforce the stereotypic under-

standing of a classroom. Finally, we looked at the type of **instruction** (i.e., whole class or small group) in which the teacher was involved. As seen in Figure 3, a

majority of second graders (68%) drew whole-group **instruction**. Most likely, these second graders actually take part in whole-group **instruction** more fre-

quently than small-group **instruction**. By comparison, the majority of preservice teachers (65%) and inservice teachers (64%) drew small-group **instruction**. It is

likely that the preservice and inservice teachers understand the value of small- group **instruction**, and in their good teacher, ideal classroom, small-group

**instruction** would be taking place.

# Picture particulars

After exploring the broader aspects of the pictures, we also

charted each unique feature in the drawings of all respondents, counting each only once for every participant. Table 2 contains the percentage of individuals

within each group that included a particular in their drawings. After charting each particular, we went back and placed the particulars into somewhat broader cate-

gories. Those categories included the **content** area being taught, classroom décor/supplies, teacher behavior/actions, student behavior/actions, physical setup

of the classroom, instructional methods, and characteristics of the people. Although there is an enormous amount of information embedded within these

particulars, we want to point out themes we found interesting within and across the three groups.

As seen in Table 2, there were a number of classroom particulars common to all three groups. Among those particulars were happy students seated at tables

taking part in student-centered, literacy **instruction**. We also looked for particu lars that were commonly drawn by a majority of participants in at least two groups.

We found that a majority of students and preservice teachers drew teach-

ers who were standing or moving, whereas a majority of students and inservice teachers drew instructional settings that were teacher directed or teacher cen-

tered. Finally, a majority of preservice and inservice teachers drew mixed-gen- der, cooperative learning environments, whereas the second graders did not.

We were also interested in which particulars seemed uniquely high within a particular group. The particulars most commonly drawn by the second graders

involved students working in whole groups on math problems either at the chalk- board or independently. The particulars uniquely common to the inservice teach-

ers’ pictures included classrooms with computers and bookshelves in which the teacher is seated in a chair and the students represent multiple cultures. With the

exception of small groups, the particulars most common to the preservice teach- ers’ pictures were also common to either the second graders’ or inservice teach-

ers’ pictures. The fact that the preservice teachers were least likely to draw unique characteristics reaffirms the developmental nature of beliefs held about

the characteristics of good teachers.

# Open-ended responses

To better understand the participants’ drawings and to

serve as a source of triangulation for our interpretations of the drawings, we asked each respondent to describe verbally what the teacher was doing and what

the students were doing. To analyze the responses, we performed key word and **content** analyses. The results listed in Tables 3 and 4 represent the percentage of

individuals within each group that mentioned a particular activity category. We attempted to keep these categories the same across both tables for the sake of

comparison. When we asked what the teachers were doing, we received a sur-

prisingly similar description across all groups. Specifically, the good teacher was taking part in active teaching of **content** (i.e., facilitating, guiding, challenging

thinking) and trying to communicate with the students. As might be expected, the participants’ descriptions were somewhat different

from what we had observed by looking at their pictures. Specifically, participants provided details about what was going on beyond what could be observed in a

two-dimensional picture. For example, more than 40% of the preservice teachers stated that the teachers in their drawings were taking part in some sort of class-

room management—a detail that would be hard to capture in a still picture. This

was not the case with the other two groups. Preservice teachers’ preoccupation with classroom management has been documented in the teacher education liter-

ature (Woolfolk-Hoy & Murphy, 2001). As such, this finding reaffirms the notion that preservice teachers believe that good teachers spend a great deal of time

managing their classrooms. We also asked the respondents to explain or describe what the students were

doing in the pictures. Surprisingly, we again found a high degree of similarity across the three groups. In particular, a majority of all three groups explained that

the students were engaged in the active learning of literacy. The responses of the preservice teachers and inservice teachers also suggested that the students were

taking part in some form of organizing. Although this organization occurred in different settings (e.g., at centers, tables, or small groups), all of the students

were getting ready to do something. A high percentage of these two groups also described the students as communicating with the teacher or other students.

Rather than communicating, the second graders often described the students as doing some sort of physical activity. Among the activities were jumping rope,

walking around the classroom, throwing, looking around, and climbing.

# Discussion

The overarching goal of this investigation was to explore individuals’ beliefs

about the characteristics of good teaching. We were also interested in the devel- opmental aspects of such beliefs, for instance, how early beliefs about good

teaching are formed and how parallel they are to the beliefs espoused by students enrolled in preservice teacher training program. Finally, does there appear to be

any difference between the beliefs of preservice and inservice teachers regarding good teaching? Prior to offering any conclusions from this study, however, it is

important that we expose or include the limitations of this work. First, we too are “insiders” and have our own set of beliefs about good teach-

ing. In this way, it is likely that our analyses of the qualitative aspects of our find- ings were filtered through our biases. Thus, in our exploration of the data, we

have heeded Peshkin’s (1988) advice. Specifically, Peshkin admonished researchers to continually monitor themselves and their feelings, and we per-

formed multiple codings on the drawings and open-ended questions so that no one rater’s beliefs biased this process. In addition, this study also relied on the

assumption that the participant groups would be honest and possess the capacity to take part in self-report and reflection. To compensate for the possibility that

individuals would or could not be forthright, we collected data via several dif- ferent methods as a mechanism for triangulating their beliefs (i.e., survey, draw-

ings, and open-ended questions). Finally, we selected the three groups of indi- viduals who participated in this study. Had we not selected second graders, the

developmental outcomes may have appeared very different. In addition, had we assessed the preservice teachers after student teaching, their beliefs may have

more closely mirrored that of the inservice teachers. Thus, the outcomes of this study should be read in light of these caveats.

As has been suggested in previous research (e.g., Tuckman, 1995), we found that good teachers are believed to be caring, patient, not boring, and polite. Fur-

ther, it does not seem necessary to be softspoken, ordinary, or strict to be con- sidered a good teacher. What we also found that has not been discussed in pre-

vious literature is that there was a great deal of agreement about the characteristics of good teachers across varying educational communities. That

is, second graders, preservice teachers, and inservice teachers seem to agree eas- ily on the requisite characteristics for being a good teacher, as well as on those

characteristics that good teachers do not need to possess. From the respondents’ pictures, we found that good teachers and good teaching are characterized by

student-centered **instruction** where the students are happy and the teacher is standing or moving around the classroom. Although this may sound somewhat

trite, the belief that active teaching leads to active learning in which teachers and students are communicating ideas does seem foundational to quality learning.

Because students are both learning to read and reading to learn in the primary grades, it seems quite understandable that literacy as a **content** area was found

to be important. There was some inconsistency between the beliefs of the three educational

groups. For example, there appeared to be a great deal of discrepancy about how important it was for a good teacher to be likeable or not forgetful. One explana-

tion for these results may lie in the nature of the constructs. For example, although most teachers appreciate being liked, being likeable may not play a

valuable role in the formation of a good teacher. As such, the construct itself sets up an artificial conflict regarding its importance. Similarly, students and teachers

not affiliated with the primary grades may react differently concerning the impor- tance of these characteristics.

Over the past decade or so, the perception that preservice teachers are insiders has become quite common (e.g., Pajares, 1992). Unlike doctors or lawyers, stu-

dents enter teacher preparation programs with at least 12 years of prior exposure to good and bad teaching. Moreover, the assumption is that students acquire

entire belief systems about both what it means to be a teacher and what knowl- edge is required to perform the job well during those insider years (Woolfolk-

Hoy & Murphy, 2001). Until this present study, however, such an understanding has been nothing more than an assumption. What we found is that students seem

to begin assembling these intricate beliefs systems as early as the second grade. Indeed, the second graders in our study drew elaborate pictures of good teachers

and good teaching. Moreover, they were able to describe cogently what the teachers and students were doing in their pictures. Thus, individuals involved in

teacher training programs need to be aware that when individuals enter such pro- grams, they are likely to be equipped with a variety of beliefs that have accumu-

lated over a decade. Moreover, research suggests that the longer one has a cer- tain belief, the harder it is to change (Chinn & Brewer, 1993). On a more positive

note, our research findings would suggest that the second graders’ beliefs do not seem very far removed from the **instruction** given in teacher training programs.

Finally, we were interested in the extent to which this study would reveal any trends in the development of beliefs about good teachers and good teaching. We

found at least two separate instances of developmental trends in the respondents’ beliefs. In both cases, the beliefs of the individual groups progressed in sophisti-

cation from the second graders to the preservice teachers to the inservice teach- ers. For example, we found that second graders and the preservice teachers

ranked five of the characteristics the same and the preservice teachers and the inservice teachers ranked five characteristics the same. However, the second

graders and the inservice teachers ranked only one characteristic (i.e., caring) the same.

A similar trend was also evident in the picture particulars coded for the draw- ings. That is, there was very little similarity between the second graders and the

inservice teachers, but similarities were common among the second graders and preservice teachers and among the preservice teachers and inservice teachers.

Given that the study was cross-sectional in design, we admit that it is difficult to be certain about any trends that seem developmental in nature. Nonetheless, we

believe that there were identifiable differences or changes evident among these groups. As such, we offer this evidence in light of the aforementioned caveat and

encourage others to conduct more longitudinal studies.

# Implications for Research and ****Practice****

The results of this study also provide implications for research and practice. Perhaps the most important implication for research is that complementary meth-

ods have the potential to provide very different information. Specifically, when the participants rated the importance of various characteristics of good teachers, we

employed a preexisting, reliable measure. Despite that fact, we found that, when given the opportunity to draw a good teacher and good teaching, our participants

drew teachers displaying characteristics that were somewhat different from those available on the Tuckman (1995) measure. Similarly, we found that our assess-

ment of the participants’ pictures did not generally encompass all that the pictures were intended to convey. As such, having our respondents explain their pictures

nicely complemented our own assessments. Thus, we would encourage the use of multiple, complementary research methods when beliefs are being explored.

Beliefs about good teachers seem to be formed at an early age and stay con- sistent, even throughout teacher preparation. The implications of these findings

are valuable to not only teacher educators but also to practitioners. For teacher educators, an awareness that preservice teachers enter training with a preset

belief system is vital. Discovering what deeply held beliefs their students bring into the training program could guide decisions and instructional approaches.

Because some change was visible among the various educational groups, this may indicate that beliefs become more explicit and open to change during

teacher training. However, it is likely that such change will not come easily. If beliefs about good teaching are formed as early as second grade, they have been

solidified by years of repeated experiences. For practitioners, it seems imperative that primary grade teachers (and teach-

ers at all levels) understand how powerfully beliefs about teaching are being shaped in their classrooms. Both personal and professional characteristics of

teachers heavily influence students’ understandings of the teaching profession. To preserve the integrity and longevity of the teaching profession, more students

need to be encouraged to consider teaching as a career. Consequently, their set of beliefs about what defines a good teacher will play an integral role in that deci-

sion-making process. In essence, we must be mindful that the apprenticeship of observation that is taking place in schools begins early and that those insider

beliefs will influence future generations of educators.
