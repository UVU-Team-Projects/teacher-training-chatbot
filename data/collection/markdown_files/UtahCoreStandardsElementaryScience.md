# Utah Core Standards

# UTAH SCIENCE WITH ENGINEERING EDUCATION (SEEd) STANDARDS

# Grade 2

The second-grade SEEd standards provide a framework for students to construct explana­

tions for how matter on Earth’s surface changes. Students investigate how living things live in habitats and have body structures that best fit their needs. Students use models to ex­

plain the forms and properties of matter. Additionally, students design solutions to prob­ lems that exist in these areas.

# Strand 2.1: CHANGES IN THE EARTH’S SURFACE

Earth has an ancient history of slow and gradual surface changes, punctuated with quick but

powerful geologic events like volcanic eruptions, flooding, and earthquakes. Water and wind play a significant role in changing Earth’s surface. The effects of wind and water can cause

both slow and quick changes to the surface of the Earth. Scientists and engineers design solu­ tions to slow or prevent wind or water from changing the land.

# Standard 2.1.1

Develop and use models illustrating the patterns of landforms and water on Earth. Examples of models could include valleys, canyons, or

floodplains and could depict water in the solid or liquid state. (ESS2.B, Ess2.c)

# Standard 2.1.2

Construct an explanation about changes in Earth’s surface that happen

quickly or slowly. Emphasize the contrast between fast and slow changes. Examples of fast changes could include volcanic eruptions, earthquakes,

or landslides. Examples of slow changes could include the erosion of mountains or the shaping of canyons. (ESS1.C)


# Standard 2.1.3

Design solutions to slow or prevent wind or water from changing the shape of land. Define the problem by asking questions and gathering

information, convey designs through sketches, drawings, or physical models, and compare and test designs. Examples of solutions could include

retaining walls, dikes, windbreaks, shrubs, trees, and grass to hold back wind, water, and land. (ESS2.A, ETS1.A, ETS1.B, ETS1.C)

# Strand 2.2: LIVING THINGS AND THEIR HABITATS 

Living things (plants and animals, including humans) need water, air, and resources from the

land to survive and live in habitats that provide these necessities. The physical characteristics of plants and animals reflect the habitat in which they live. Animals also have modified behav­

iors that **help** them survive, grow, and meet their needs. Humans sometimes mimic plant and animal adaptations to survive in their **environment**.

# Standard 2.2.1

Obtain, evaluate, and communicate information about patterns of living things (plants and animals, including humans) in different

habitats. Emphasize the diversity of living things in land and water habitats. Examples of patterns in habitats could include descriptions of

temperature or precipitation and the types of plants and animals found in land habitats. (LS2.C, LS4.C, LS4.D)

# Standard 2.2.2

Plan and carry out an investigation of the structure and function of plant and animal parts in different habitats. Emphasize how different

plants and animals have different structures to survive in their habitat. Examples could include the shallow roots of a cactus in the desert or the

seasonal changes in the fur coat of a wolf. (LS1.A, LS4.C, LS4.D) 

# Standard 2.2.3

Develop and use a model that mimics the function of an animal

dispersing seeds or pollinating plants. Examples could include plants that have seeds with hooks or barbs that attach themselves to animal

fur, feathers, or human clothing, or dispersal through the wind, or consumption of fruit and the disposal of the pits or seeds. (LS2.A)

# Standard 2.2.4

Design a solution to a human problem by mimicking the structure and function of plants and/or animals and how they use their external parts

to **help** them survive, grow, and meet their needs. Define the problem by asking questions and gathering information, convey designs through

sketches, drawings, or physical models, and compare and test designs. Examples could include a human wearing a jacket to mimic the fur of an

animal or a webbed foot to design a better swimming fin. (LS1.A, LS1.D, Ets1.a, ets1.b, ets1.c)

# Strand 2.3: PROPERTIES OF MATTER

All things are made of matter which exists with different forms and properties. Matter can be described and classified by its observable properties. Materials with certain properties are

well-suited for specific uses. Heating or cooling some types of matter may or may not irrevers­ ibly change their properties.

# Standard 2.3.1

Plan and carry out an investigation to classify different kinds of materials based on patterns in their observable properties. Examples

could include sorting materials based on similar properties such as strength, color, flexibility, hardness, texture, or whether the materials are

solids or liquids. (PS1.A) 

# Standard 2.3.2

Construct an explanation showing how the properties of materials

influence their intended use and function. Examples could include using wood as a building material because it is lightweight and strong or the

use of concrete, steel, or cotton due to their unique properties. (PS1.A) 

# Standard 2.3.3

Develop and use a model to describe how an object, made of a small

set of pieces, can be disassembled and reshaped into a new object with a different function. Emphasize that a great variety of objects can be built

from a small set of pieces. Examples of pieces could include wooden blocks or building bricks. (PS1.A)

# Standard 2.3.4

Obtain, evaluate, and communicate information about changes in matter caused by heating or cooling. Emphasize that some changes can

be reversed and some cannot. Examples of reversible changes could include freezing water or melting crayons. Examples of irreversible

changes could include cooking an egg or burning wood. (PS1.B)
