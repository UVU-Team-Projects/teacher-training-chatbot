# Gifted and Talented Handbook

# Why are **gifted** and talented programs needed?

In considering the variety of philosophical perspectives that can be taken, districts will be

able to develop a rationale for **gifted** and talented education. Such a rationale is important for creating defensible programs for **gifted** and talented learners. Dr. Barbara Clark (2008) has

identified several bases that can serve as a foundation.

# 1. right to learn

“Giftedness” is a label used to indicate a high level of intelligence; it has a dynamic qual­

ity that can be furthered only by participation in learning experiences that challenge and extend the child’s level of intelligence, ability, and interest.

# 2. equal opportunity

The school, as an extension of society’s principle of equity, purports to provide an equal

educational opportunity for all children so they can develop their intellect and talents to the fullest potential. Because all children must, therefore, be educated at their level

of development, it is against the principles of a just society to refuse **gifted** and talent­ ed children the right educational experiences appropriate to their developed level of

ability.

# 3. individual cost

When human beings are limited and restricted in their development, we run the risk of

creating both physical and psychological dysfunction.

# 4. talent development

Society gains from the greatest advancement of all the abilities and from the highest

development of all the talents of all its members, whatever their areas of strength.

# 5. individual differences

Gifted youngsters often think differently and have different interests than their age-

mates. They usually enter school having already developed many basic skills, sometimes to high levels. They have areas of interest that have developed into advanced areas of

knowledge.

# 6. individual growth

When the needs of the **gifted** and talented students are recognized and the education­

al program is designed to meet their needs, these students make significant gains in achievement, and their sense of competence is enhanced.

# 7. societal benefit

Contribute to society in all areas of human endeavor come in overweighed proportion

from **gifted** individuals. District personnel would benefit from discussing these rationales and determining, based

on local values, which perspectives are best suited for establishing **gifted** and talented ed­ ucation as an integral part of the total educational program their district offers. Having this

discussion will assist a district in developing its sense of mission or purpose for **gifted** and talented education.

# Typical Misconceptions About Gifted and Talented Learners

In our society and our schools, we may hold a number of beliefs that make it difficult to devel­ op quality programs for **gifted** and talented learners. Open and honest discussion about these

misconceptions is important for fostering the collaborative efforts needed to properly serve students with gifts and talents.

# Misconception 1: All children are **gifted** and talented.

Points to consider: Everyone accepts that all children are unique, special, important, have

personal strengths and weaknesses, and have contributions to make to the classroom and ultimately to their communities and to society. However, the term **gifted** and talented

refers to a specific population that has specific educational needs. While almost everyone would agree that every child should have vaccinations to enter a public school, not every

child needs insulin injections every day. The latter is based on identified need by a quali­ fied professional. The same would hold true for students with differentiated educational

needs.

# Misconception 2: Gifted and talented education is elitist.

Points to consider: This misconception comes from the dual nature of the word elite. In one sense the word elite refers to differences in performance. This is most often used in

conjunction with extraordinary athletic performance, as in “an elite gymnast.” Very few would argue against providing such athletes with elite-level coaching and training. The

same holds true for those who exhibit gifts and talents in other areas, as listed in the official definition provided earlier in this section. Unfortunately, the word elite also re­

fers to differences in class. Individuals from upper classes are often stereotyped as being snobbish—considering themselves to be better than other people. This latter sense of

the word, based on class, runs counter to the value American society places on equity. In this sense, **gifted** and talented education seems to be perceived as maintaining existent

inequities. However, in the former sense of the word, based on performance, **gifted** and talented education fosters excellence, another important societal value in America.

Indeed, elite treatment based on performance has been one important route for op­ pressed populations (e.g., economically disadvantaged, ethnic and linguistic minorities)

to overcome class differences and to achieve equity goals.

# Misconception 3: Gifted and talented students can make it on their own.

Points to consider: This misconception is again based on a divergence of opinion about definitions. When “make it” refers to the likelihood that **gifted** and talented students will

meet grade level objectives on end-of-year criterion-referenced tests, it is very likely that they will succeed, meeting minimum criteria for adequate yearly progress. So if “make

it” refers to a short-term achievement goal, **gifted** and talented students often do so “on their own.” However, if “make it” refers to a more long-term objective of life success, the

misconception simply doesn’t hold. Gifted and talented students are just as much at risk as other populations for suicide, mental illness (probably more so among those who are

**gifted** and talented at creative thinking), juvenile delinquency, drug abuse, and dropping out of school. The greatest concern for **gifted** and talented learners is underachievement.

18 While estimates vary, most scholars would agree that the majority of **gifted** and talented

students underachieve. The reasons for this are varied and complex—including personal, family, and societal issues. However, one primary cause of underachievement can be laid

squarely at the feet of schools—the mismatch between a student’s developmental read­ iness for challenging work and the educational program he or she is offered. This failure

to provide learning experiences based on specific needs of specific students frequently results in a failure of the student to “make it,” where “make it” refers to the realization of the

potential the student brought into the school in the first place.

# Misconception 4: Teachers challenge all students; therefore, **gifted** kids will be fine in the regular classroom.

Points to consider: Although teachers try to challenge all students, the reality is that with­

out training regarding the characteristics and needs of **gifted** and talented students, reg­ ular classroom teachers are often unprepared to provide the depth of knowledge and

rigor these students need. In addition, because state and federal regulations ask teachers to focus on students who are scoring below proficiency on core tests: the needs of **gifted**

and talented students are often not met. The National Research Center of Gifted and Tal­ ented (NRC/GT) found that 61% of classroom teachers had no training in teaching highly

able students, limiting the challenging educational opportunities offered to advanced learners.

In addition, the Fordham Institute found that 58% of all teachers have had no staff devel­ opment regarding the learning needs of academically advanced students (NAGC, 2008).

# Misconception 5: Gifted students serve as good role models so that everyone else in the class is smarter.

Points to consider: The reality is that average or below average students do not look to **gifted** students as role models. They most often model their behavior on those who have

similar capabilities. Comparing oneself to a student who does progressively better on an assignment or activity does little to **help** average or low-performing students build their

self-esteem. Rather, they might not understand the differences in performance and may have little understanding about how to make improvements based on the work done by

a **gifted** student. Similarly, **gifted** students also benefit most from interactions with intel­ lectual peers who show similar performance levels (NAGC, 2008).

# Misconception 6: Acceleration options for **gifted** students are socially harmful.

Points to consider: Gifted and talented students are often found interacting with stu­

dents who are older. They may feel these students have interests and abilities more similar to their own. Although acceleration may not be appropriate for every **gifted** student, it

should not be ruled out as an option when designing programs for **gifted** and talented learners.

According to James A. Kulik of the University of Michigan, “Meta-analytic reviews have consistently concluded that educational acceleration helps students academically with­

out shortchanging them socially and emotionally” (Kulik, 2004). Grade skipping, early kin­ dergarten or magnet school programs may need to be considered to meet the diverse

needs of **gifted** and talented students.

# Misconception 7: This student can’t be **gifted**! He/she has such poor grades.

Points to consider: When **gifted** and talented students already know much of their curric­ ulum they may not see relevance in what they are doing in school. This lack of interest in

what is happening in the classroom may lead to underachievement. Underachievement is a discrepancy between a particular student’s performance and his

or her ability. Poor grades may be an indication that the student needs a different level of challenge in a particular unit, **lesson** or activity in order to see value or worth in what he

or she is learning.

# Misconception 8: Gifted students are happy, popular and well-adjusted.

Points to consider: Like other students, **gifted** and talented students are most happy in school when their needs are being met, when they feel teachers understand them and

when they have opportunities to work with students who are like them. When their needs are not being met, or when they are not in an **environment** either at school or in their

community that supports them, **gifted** students can show signs of depression or dissat­ isfaction. They may also differ from other students in terms of their emotional and moral

intensity, their sensitivity to expectations and feelings, their tendency to be too perfec­ tionistic and their deep concerns about societal concerns resulting in isolation or being

labeled as “too smart” or “nerdy.” When school is a negative place, they may feel it is some­ thing to be endured rather than celebrated.

# Misconception 9: Gifted and learning **disabled** can’t go together.

Points to consider: Gifted and talented students are found in all populations, including

those who may have learning **disabilities**. These “twice-exceptional” students may not be recognized for **gifted** and talented services because the **disability** might mask the ability,

or because they are already receiving services for their learning **disability** and hence are not even considered for **gifted** and talented programs. Twice-exceptional students need

to be recognized for their abilities and provided with challenging curriculum and **help** for their **disability**.

# Misconception 10: AP and IB courses are all a district needs to offer for **gifted** and talented students.

Points to consider: While Advanced Placement and International Baccalaureate programs do offer advanced coursework, they are not designed as **gifted** and talented programs.

These programs are designed for college-bound students and do not necessarily provide the depth, rigor, independent study, and **content** options needed by **gifted** and talented

students.

# Characteristics and Needs of Gifted and Talented Students

What are the characteristics and needs of **gifted** and talented

students? Any process for discovering **gifted** and talented students

begins with an understanding of their characteristics. These characteristics imply certain needs which, in turn, lead to ser­

vices that meet those needs.

# Characteristics of **gifted** and talented learners

# Characteristics

1. Extraordinary quantity of information

2. Unusually varied interests

3. High level of language development

4. Unusual capacity for processing informa­tion

5. Flexible thought processes

6. Ability to generate original ideas and solu­tions

7. Unusual intensity

8. Unusual sensitivity to the expectations and feelings of others

9. Keen sense of humor

10. Heightened self-awareness

# Needs

1. To be exposed to new and challenging in­ formation

2. To be allowed to pursue individual ideas as far as interest takes them

3. To encounter uses for increasingly difficult vocabulary and concepts

4. To be exposed to ideas at many levels and in large variety

5. To be allowed to solve problems in diverse ways

6. To be given the opportunity to contribute to the solution of meaningful problems

7. To pursue inquiries beyond allotted time spans

8. To learn to clarify the feelings and expecta­tions of others

9. To learn how behavior affects the feelings and behavior of others

10. To learn to assert own needs and feelings nondefensively

Teachers should use checklists of indicators of giftedness to **help** them identify the students

who require differentiated curriculum and **instruction** in the regular classroom. More information on this is provided in Chapter 6, “Curriculum, ******Instruction******, and Assessment.”

In addition, teachers are usually asked to observe students in their classrooms to make refer­ rals for possible inclusion in specific **gifted** and talented program services.

Generally when teachers have not had training in the characteristics of **gifted** and talented children, they tend to refer students who do well on classroom assignments and who have

good behavior. While the characteristics in the chart above are generally stated in a positive fash­ ion, they are sometimes manifested negatively. Further, each characteristic will often have cul­

turally specific ways in which it is shown. Teachers need to be sensitive to these differences as explained in Chapter 9, “Special Populations.”

# Principles of Gifted and Talented Identification

# What principles or guidelines should govern the **gifted** and talented identification process?

******School****** districts that are most successful in identifying **gifted** and talented students are gen­ erally governed by the following principles or guidelines:

1. Seeking variety in identification by having a clear, inclusive definition of **gifted** and talent­ ed (Callahan, Hunsaker, Adams, Moore, & Bland, 1995; Davis & Rimm, 2004; Richert, 2003).

2. Using multiple criteria, not multiple hurdles (Callahan, et al., 1995; Clark, 2008; Davis & Rimm, 2004; U.S. Department of ******Education******, 1993).

3. Using unique, separate instrumentation for different areas of giftedness and talent (Calla­ han, et al., 1995; Davis & Rimm, 2004).

4. Basing identification and placement on student need, linking identification to the specif­ ic services to be offered (Callahan, et al., 1995; Davis & Rimm, 2004).

5. Making identification fluid and ongoing (Davis & Rimm, 2004; U.S. Department of Educa­ tion, 1983; Shore, Cornell, Robinson, & Ward,1991).

6. Recognizing that the purpose of identification is to find and develop exceptional poten­ tial (Clark, 2008; U.S. Department of ******Education******, 1993; Richert, 2003).

# Stages of a Formal Gifted and Talented Identification Process

# What are the stages of a formal **gifted** and talented identification process?

There are generally four broad stages or steps for identifying students as **gifted** and talented. The stages described here should be seen as a skeletal outline only. Details of the stages will

vary, and perhaps even overlap, depending on local circumstances, including the scope of the identification (e.g., school or district level), the type of program (e.g., pull-out or magnet),

and the focus of planning (e.g., child or program). Typically, each of the stages is overseen either by a small committee that includes individuals with expertise in **gifted** and talented

education, test interpretation, or school administration, or by a **gifted** and talented program coordinator.

Step or Stage 1 consists of referral, screening, or nomination. Referral occurs when teach­ ers observe students in their classrooms to suggest who should be further considered in the

identification processes. To do this well, teachers usually need training in the definition of **gifted** and talented and the characteristics of **gifted** and talented learners. The referral usually

works best when teachers are given a checklist or rating scale on which to report their obser­ vations. Screening involves an inspection of census norm-referenced testing done in the dis­

trict. Generally a cutoff is set (e.g., the 85th percentile), and any student who meets or exceeds the cutoff on the total battery or a predetermined sub-score (e.g., total reading, total math)

is automatically advanced in the process for further consideration. Nomination gives an op­ portunity for non-educators to recommend students for consideration. Four types of nomi­

nations are usually taken: self, peer, parent, and community member. Usually the nominator is asked to provide evidence concerning why the nomination is being made. Some schools

formalize this process by requiring the nominator to complete a checklist, rating scale, or open-ended questionnaire.

Step or Stage 2 is the data-gathering

stage. At this point in the process, the committee or coordinator will review the

records of all students whose names were received from Stage 1. Applying a specific

set of criteria—usually a preponderance of evidence standard is set; a determination is

made about which students will continue through the process.

Parental permission is obtained; then the needed information is gathered through

additional testing, observation, or other means. It is important, in the name of fair­

ness, to make sure that the data on each student is as equivalent as possible.

Step or Stage 3, decision making, be­ gins once all the data is gathered. At this

stage, the data are usually synthesized in some fashion and a decision is reached re­

garding services for the child. Several data synthesis methods have been employed by

school districts, including matrix displays, case study summaries, admissions formu­

las, and statistical analyses. Exploring the possibilities mentioned here with experi­

enced **gifted** leaders or experts is strongly recommended. However, in developing

decision-making strategies, it is important to remember that any system used has its

advantages and disadvantages. Step or Stage 4, service planning, re­

quires that a specific course of action be taken relative to the student’s par­

ticipation in various service options. The most basic action taken at this stage

is placement in a specific service, such as a magnet classroom or pull- out program.

Beyond this, information gained through the identification process should be used to

make recommendations to teachers about how a child’s learning experiences may be

differentiated, regardless of placement. In any case, parents must be informed, usually

by letter, of the specific actions to be taken (e.g., placement or not) and, perhaps, of rec­

ommendations for differentiation.

# SOCIAL AND EMOTIONAL NEEDS

# Five Developmental Differences in Gifted and Talented Students

1. ASYNCHRONOUS DEVELOPMENT 

What is asynchronous development? Asynchrony is the term used to describe the mismatch between cognitive, emotional, and physical development of **gifted** individuals.1 Gifted children often have

significant vari- 48 ations within themselves and develop unevenly across skill levels. For example, a **gifted** child may be excellent in math, but poor in reading—or vice versa. Often, 

intellectual skills are quite advanced, but fine motor or social skills are lagging. Experts do not completely agree, but because asynchrony is so prominent in **gifted** children, some 

professionals believe asynchronous development rather than potential or ability, is the defining characteristic of giftedness.2 A definition of giftedness that captures the essence of this 

uneven development was developed by the Columbus Group in 1991: Giftedness is asynchronous development in which advanced cognitive abilities and heightened intensity combine to create inner 

experiences and awareness that are qualitatively different from the norm. This asynchrony increases with higher intellectual capacity. The uniqueness of the **gifted** renders them particularly 

vulnerable and requires modifications in parenting, teaching, and counseling in order for them to develop optimally. 

2. OVEREXCITABILITIES 

What are overexcitabilities, and do they affect all **gifted** and talented students? Overexcitability is a theory proposed by Kazimierz Dąbrowski, a Polish psychologist, psychiatrist, and 

physician, that suggests that some individuals have heightened sensitivities, awareness, and intensity in one or more of five areas: psychomotor, sensual, intellectual, imaginational, and 

emotional. It is often quite difficult and demanding to work and live with overexcitable individuals. Those who are not so, find the behaviors unexplainable, frequently incomprehensible, and 

often bizarre. Overexcitable people living with other overexcitable people often have more compassion and understanding for each other, but may feel conflicts when their OEs are not to the same 

degree. Finding strategies for helping children and adults deal with and take advantage of these innate and enduring characteristics may seem difficult. However, resources may be gathered from 

varied places: Literature regarding counseling, learning styles, special education, and classroom management; parenting books; even popular business texts. (SENG website) 

3. PERFECTIONISM 

What is perfectionism, and are all **gifted** and talented students perfectionists? Students who exhibit perfectionism may worry excessively about assignments, attempting to do the work over and 

over to make it more presentable to the teacher, or avoiding the work altogether. These students may suffer a great deal if they feel that they do not live up to the expectations of others, and 

fear that others will find them inadequate. The focus of their **attention** is their own imperfections. They may magnify their flaws and overlook their strengths, thereby providing a distorted 

image of their own existence. The foundation of their self-concept is weak and is easily shaken by external events. They may also have a great need for self-affirmation and validation from 

others. Not all **gifted** and talented students are perfectionists. The degree of perfectionism that

any one individual may manifest varies. Some **gifted** and talented students are accused of

being perfectionists or of being too perfectionistic because their own expectations are not

congruent with their abilities. This has often been portrayed as a negative characteristic,

and for some students being too perfectionistic may be an impediment to their success in

the classroom.

It is important for teachers to understand that not all perfectionism is bad. Striving for excellence sometimes requires a degree of perfectionism. It is when perfectionistic behaviors

interfere with children’s success in school or affect their social and emotional well-being

that action may have to be taken to **help** the student. Counselors or other professionals may

need to provide guidance in helping students understand the difference between wanting

to do their best at what they are trying to accomplish and making something perfect. Schuler (2002) suggested:

1. Being cautious about viewing perfectionism as unhealthy.

2. Helping **gifted** and talented students take pleasure in their accomplishments.

3. Assisting them in viewing their setbacks as learning opportunities.

4. Praising them for their efforts and determination, rather than for being smart or talented.

5. Encouraging them to channel their efforts into things they enjoy rather than trying to do everything at a level of excellence.

4. TWICE-EXCEPTIONAL

What is a Twice Exceptional **Student**? Twice exceptional, often referred to as 2e, is a term used to describe a student who is both

**gifted** and **disabled**. These students may also be referred to as having dual exceptionalities

or as being **gifted** with learning **disabilities** (GT/LD). This also applies to students who are

**gifted** with **ADHD** or **gifted** with autism. 

Recommendations Suggested for Addressing the Needs of 2e Students

1. Enriched/advanced educational opportunities that develop the child’s interests, gifts and talents while also meeting the child’s learning needs;

2. Simultaneous supports that ensure the child’s academic success and social-emotional well-being, such as accommodations, interventions, and specialized **instruction**;

3. Programming should have as its goal dual differentiation—managing the **disability** while also developing the ability;

4. In-service training for general, special, and **gifted** education teachers on the characteristics and needs of twice-exceptional students.

5. UNDERACHIEVEMENT

What is underachievement, and are all **gifted** and talented students underachievers?

If underachievement is defined as not performing up to potential, then many if not all **gifted** and talented children are underachievers, since they are often in classrooms that do not

offer the challenge necessary to achieve that potential (Winner, 1996). However, most educators have an image of underachievers as students who dawdle, forget homework, daydream, talk too much 

to other children, have poor study skills, are slow and perfectionistic,

are sloppy and careless, or don’t do the work at all (Rimm, 1995). By this definition, not all

**gifted** and talented students are underachievers. Underachievement is considered by many

educators to be “a discrepancy between a child’s school performance and some ability index” (Delisle & Galbraith, 2002, p. 169). Siegle and McCoach (2005) pinpoint four potential

causes of underachievement:

1. A physical, cognitive, or emotional issue (e.g., a learning **disability** or family trauma)

2. A mismatch between the school **environment** and the student (e.g., lack of challenge in the curriculum)

3. A student’s attitude about himself or herself and school (e.g., a fear of failure or a lack of self-confidence)

4. Poor study skills and self-regulation

Counselors often find that underachievement can also relate to a need for **attention** or a

need for control (Colangelo, 2003).

Underachievement is as varied and complex as a classroom of students. Causes of underachievement are specific to the individual child, so intervention and remediation should

also be specific to that child. Nevertheless, a study of students who had reversed their pattern of underachievement identified the teacher as being one of the most important factors in 

motivating them to achieve. Characteristics of the teacher listed by the students as

important were as follows: someone who had a genuine caring for the student; someone

who was willing to communicate with the student by talking about interests, ideas and

personal concerns; someone who was enthusiastic about the subject taught and exhibited

a desire to learn more; and someone flexible in his or her teaching style, who used a variety of resources and methods (Emerick, 1992). The National Research Center for Gifted and

Talented, in a study on increasing the academic achievement of underachievers, found four

characteristics that students need to improve their achievement:

1. A belief in their ability to do well (known as self-efficacy);

2. A perception that required tasks are meaningful (known as task value);

3. An expectation that success is possible (known as environmental perception); and

4. The implementation of strategies that will lead to successful completion of the task (known as self-regulation) 

To begin to **help** an underachiever, teachers should gain a better understanding of the student through collaboration with parents, focus on the student’s strengths and interests, and

develop an individual plan for the student based on individual needs. Underachievement in

**gifted** and talented programs should not generally disqualify students, but should be used

as an impetus for modification of services, both within and outside the program, that the

student should be receiving to increase the likelihood of success. Gifted programs are a need,

not a privilege.

# OTHER SOCIAL AND EMOTIONAL ISSUES

What are other social and emotional issues **gifted** and talented students face?

According to Delisle and Galbraith (2002), there are a number of social and emotional issues that many **gifted** and talented students especially face. These include being more responsive to 

sensory stimuli (e.g., sound, light, smell), perceiving greater complexity in the

world around them (e.g., patterns, beauty), and experiencing greater worry about ethical

concerns (e.g., justice, **environment**). This heightened awareness or sensitivity is a particular

concern for **gifted** and talented students who lack the social or emotional maturity to cope,

or do not have sufficient knowledge or skill to develop and implement solutions. When

**gifted** and talented students are affected by these issues, the students should not generally be dismissed from **gifted** and talented programs. Rather, these issues should serve as a

springboard to focused lessons, services, or counseling within the programs.
