# Supporting and Responding to Students’ Social, Emotional, and Behavioral Needs: Evidence-Based Practices for Educators

# Positive Behavioral Interventions & Supports (PBIS)

# What are the Principles that Guide the Use of These Practices in the ******Classroom******?

The five essential elements (Figure 1) are foundational

values that drive the success of these classroom practices. When using this document, use these

elements to guide practice selection, implementation, and enhancement to maximize contextual and cultural

relevance and ultimately student benefit. • Prioritize equity. MTSS is for all

students, families, and educators. All means all; in other

words, MTSS supports individuals from all

**disability**, race/ethnicity, gender, language,

and LGBTQIA+, backgrounds. Use the

MTSS framework to differentiate supports

for students, and monitor to promote

equitable access, engagement, and benefit

among all student groups.

• Make student growth and benefit central to all decisions. ******Student******

outcomes that reflect equitable learning opportunities must be the

ultimate criteria for all decisions, including those related to practice selection, implementation,

and enhancement. • Prioritize the most efficient and effective practices.

Emphasize practices that address identified needs, have supporting evidence, and match the local

culture and context. Promote high-quality and culturally responsive implementation across time.

Integrate, align, and connect practices within domains: (a) effective environments, **instruction**,

and intervention to support SEB and academic growth and (b) high leverage academic **instruction**

to support student learning. Most importantly, do a few important and relevant practices

well, that is, with the high degree of accuracy, fluency, durability,

and adaptability. •

Use aggregated and disaggregated data to

inform decisions to (a) determine which students

need which supports (screening); (b) promote

effective implementation (fidelity); (c) continue,

adjust, or fade supports (progress monitoring);

and (d) ensure all students experience benefit

(equitable outcomes). •

Invest in systems to support high-fidelity implementation across

time. Leverage existing leadership teams to guide planning and implementation, and consider

efficient and effective means to support educators’ professional learning and wellness within current experience, and expertise.

# What Does This Guide Include?

This guide prioritizes practices that are (a) designed

to promote students’ SEB growth, (b) consistent with positive and proactive values, (c) free to implement (not

packaged programs), and (d) supported by empirical evidence across contexts (e.g., elementary, middle,

high, and alternative schools; students from diverse backgrounds and with diverse needs). Footnotes

provide research citations that support each practice. Research demonstrates that each practice is associated

with positive outcomes (Long et al., 2019; Oliver et al., 2011; Simonsen et al., 2008. Sutherland et al., 2019),

including: • Improved SEB and academic outcomes,

• Decreased SEB challenges and contextually inappropriate behavior, and/or

• Reduced use of reactive and exclusionary discipline.

# What Terms Should I Know?

This guide describes and defines key practices in detail, but there are a few basic terms that will make it easier

to follow: • Social, emotional, and behavioral (SEB) describes

three inter-related concepts: how students interact (social), feel (emotional), and act (behavioral) that

are critical components of overall well-being (Chafouleas, 2020) and mental health (CDC, 2020).

• Context refers to the physical, instructional, social, situational, or other circumstances that are present

when (a) students use SEB or academic skills and/ or (b) contextually (in)appropriate behaviors occur.

• Contextually (in)appropriate behavior recognizes that (a) all behavior occurs in a context (see above)

and (b) behavior is appropriate or inappropriate based on context. For example, “talking without

raising a hand” (behavior) may be contextually inappropriate during teacher lecture (when

hand raising is expected), but contextually appropriate during small group discussion (when

active participation is expected). Contextually appropriate behaviors are consistent with situational

expectations, learning, and safety and considerate of students’ culture and individual needs; and

contextually inappropriate behaviors are inconsistent with situational expectations, learning, and safety.

This guide describes contextually inappropriate behaviors as SEB “errors” (in the same way that

applying an academic skill in the incorrect context is an academic error). Thus, instructional, rather than

reactive or exclusionary, responses are appropriate to (a) support the student in learning and practicing

contextually appropriate behavior and (b) “correct” the SEB error.

• Evidence-based practice refers to practices supported by empirical evidence and local data.

# Steps to Support and Respond to Students’ SEB Needs

# 1.1 Design a Safe Environment

Effectively design the physical **environment** of the classroom to promote SEB and academic growth\*

• Design classroom layout to

facilitate the most typical instructional activities (e.g.,

small groups, whole group, learning centers)

• Arrange furniture to allow for proximity and smooth teacher

and student movement • Assure instructional materials

are neat, orderly, and ready for use by all students

• Consider primary language(s) and unique student needs,

ensure accessibility, and promote inclusion

• Post visuals that support critical **content** and learning

practices (e.g., word walls, steps for the writing process,

mathematical formulas), and reflect diversity of the

classroom community • Create a classroom layout

that matches the type of activity taking place, for

example: • Tables for centers

• Separate space for independent work

• Circle area for group **instruction**

• Ensure all students, including students in wheelchairs or

with a range of mobility needs, can move around the

space and access materials • Create a calm space where

students can take a break and practice self-management

strategies • Consider teacher and student

access to materials and use images and/or students’

primary language(s) to label materials

• Ensure all student spaces are visible

• Create a classroom layout that matches the type of

activity taking place, for example:

• Circle for discussion • Forward facing for group

**instruction** • Consider students’ unique

needs (e.g., mobility, access to calm space, primary

language(s)), and use universal design to create

an **environment** that works for all

• Consider options for storage of students’ personal items

(e.g., backpacks, notebooks for other classes)

• Ensure posted **content** celebrates diversity (e.g.,

racial/ethnic backgrounds, nationalities, spoken

languages, diverse abilities, family composition) of

students in the classroom • Ensure all student spaces are

visible Do not…

• Store equipment and materials in a manner that is

unorganized, unsafe, and/or not accessible to all students

• Allow classroom to stay disorderly, messy, unclean,

and/or visually unappealing • Design a space where some

students and/or parts of the room are not visible

to teacher • Create congestion in high-

traffic areas (e.g., coat closet, pencil sharpener, teacher

desk) • Post bulletin boards, displays,

and other visuals in the classroom that reflect only

the teacher or some members of the class community,

missing the opportunity to celebrate all students’

racial, ethnic, and cultural backgrounds.

# 1.2 Establish Positive Connections

Learn about your students and establish positive connections among students, families, and educators\*

• Establish positive connections

with students, families, and other members of

the classroom community through purposeful

communication • Build in regular opportunities

for positive connection throughout the year (e.g.,

positive family postcards, email, brief check-ins,

scheduled meetings) and adjust based on families’

language and communication preferences

• Use formal and informal approaches to learn about

students and understand their learning history, cultural identity,

and preferences for learning, receiving feedback, etc.

• Authentically engage families as partners in learning

• Validate and affirm† students’ and families’ personal and

cultural learning histories • Introduce yourself and the

classroom to students and families at the start of the

year (e.g., brief video, letter, opportunity to visit, open

house) • Survey families before the

start of school to learn more about students

• Engage students in activities to continue to learn about

each member of the classroom community,

and ask questions about preferences (e.g., praise

preference assessment) • Maintain regular

communication with families, and ensure that families

have opportunities to share information and feedback,

receive positive news, and proactively problem

solve challenges consistent with their language/

communication preferences • Introduce yourself to

students and families at the start of the year (e.g., brief

video, email, letter) • Survey students and families

before the start of school to learn more about preferences

(e.g., praise preference assessment) and what

supports they need to be successful

• Engage students in activities to **help** them learn more about

themselves and each other • Maintain open lines of

communication with students and families outside

of class (e.g., email, learning management system) to

share information and feedback, positive news, and

communicate challenges consistent with their

language and communication preferences

Do not… • Miss an opportunity to

create a positive experience welcoming students and

families • Assume students and

families will contact you with questions

• Use a one-size-fits all approach to interacting with

students and families • Contact families only when

there are concerns (or have these types of contact be the

most frequent communication families experience)

• Engage exclusively in 1-directional communication

(e.g., only sharing information via newsletters) based solely

on teacher’s language and communication preferences.

# 1.3 Develop Predictable Routines

Develop and teach predictable classroom routines to promote SEB and academic skill growth\*

• Establish a predictable

schedule and co-develop clear procedures for each

teaching and learning activity and transitions between

activities with students • Post steps for specific

routines to promote independence

• Teach routines and procedures explicitly

(in combination with expectations, using classroom

matrix see 1.4) • ******Practice****** regularly and re­

teach throughout the year • Provide specific feedback for

students’ use of routines and procedures

• Promote self-managed or student-guided schedules

and routines • Consider routines for:

• Arrival and dismissal (see example below)

• Transitions between activities

• Accessing **help** • What to do after work is

completed • Technology use

• Example arrival routine (posted with words &

pictures): • Hang up coat and backpack

• Put notes and homework in the “In” basket

• Sharpen two pencils • Go to desk and begin the

warm-up activities listed on the board

• If you finish early, read a book

• Consider routines for: • Turning in work

• Transitions between activities

• Handing out materials • Making up missed work

• What to do after work is completed

• Technology use • Example class period routine

(posted on smartboard and/or in students’ planners):

• Warm-up activity for students

• Review of previous **content**

• ******Instruction****** for new material

• Guided or independent practice opportunities

• Wrap-up activities Do not…

• Assume students will automatically know routines

and procedures without **instruction** and feedback

• Omit defining and teaching routines for typical activities,

transitions, or new events (e.g., field trip, assembly)

• Miss opportunity to provide visual and/or auditory

reminders about routines and procedures (e.g., signs,

posters, pictures, hand signals, certain music playing,

timers) feedback about student performance.

# 1.4 Define & Teach Positive Expectations

Co-develop, define, post, and explicitly teach a few (3-5) positive classroom expectations or norms to enhance engagement\*

• If school implements a multi-

tiered behavioral framework, such as PBIS, adopt the 3-5

positive school expectations as classroom expectations

• If school expectations do not exist, co-develop positive

classroom expectations with students and post

• Collaborate with students and families to define expectations

in ways that are observable, measurable, positively stated,

understandable, and culturally relevant

# Non-Examples

• Teach expectations using examples and

and with opportunities to practice and receive

feedback, and reteach during the year

• Validate, Affirm, Build, and Bridge (VABB)† to honor

students’ personal and cultural learning histories

when teaching expectations • Co-develop classroom matrix

with students to define contextually appropriate

behaviors and SEB skills for each expectation in each

classroom setting or routine (e.g., being safe means

hands, feet, and objects to self during transitions) in

a manner that celebrates shared values and student

voice • Have students create posters

to illustrate expectations (e.g., be **kind** to others,

**environment**, and self) • Teach the expectations at

the beginning of the year as each routine occurs, actively

engage students in practice with feedback, and review

throughout the year • Regularly refer to

expectations when prompting or providing specific feedback

• Co-develop classroom matrix with students to define

contextually appropriate behaviors and SEB skills for

each expectation in each setting or routine (e.g.,

being respectful means using inclusive language) in

a manner that celebrates shared values and student

voice • Have students design

posters, brief videos, and website **content** to illustrate

expectations (e.g., be a good citizen, and be ready to learn)

• Engage students in developing relevant lessons

for peers and explicitly teach SEB skills

• Regularly refer to expectations when interacting

with students, teaching **content**, developing skills for

college and career readiness Do not…

• Assume students will already know how to engage in

SEB skills consistent with expectations and miss

opportunity to teach • Have more than five

expectations • Only list behaviors that do

not meet expectations (e.g., no cell phones, no talking, no

gum, no hitting) • Create expectations that you

are not willing to consistently prompt and monitor

• Select expectations that are not culturally relevant

• Select expectations that do not match students’

developmental level • Choose expectations that

do not sufficiently cover all situations

# 1.5 Plan Relevant ****Instruction****

Consider your students’ learning history when selecting relevant curriculum,\* planning effective **instruction**,† and considering differentiation‡

• Ensure the instructional

materials and activities celebrate diversity of

students and families, (e.g., race/ethnicity, family

composition, languages, cultural traditions, genders,

physical strengths and needs, **disabilities**, SES, local history)

• Select curricula (or adapt existing curricula) and

activities (e.g., jigsaw) that are relevant for your students’

learning history and needs • Consider various dimensions

of each activity (e.g., difficulty, duration of task, choice,

communication needs) and relevant accommodations to

meet student needs • Plan to differentiate to meet

the needs of all learners (e.g., pre-teach prerequisite skills,

provide alternative ways to access and respond to

materials, flexible grouping) • Consider students’ interests

and backgrounds when selecting **attention** signals

(e.g., call and response, a range of song lyrics) and

other classroom activities • Ensure classroom materials

(e.g., books in classroom library, posters, activities,

games), **content**, and activities teach and celebrate diversity

in the classroom and community

• Consider task dimensions when planning **instruction**

(e.g., incorporate choice, alternate between difficult

and easier tasks), and adjust task dimensions (e.g.,

response mode, pre-teaching) to accommodate unique

needs and differentiate supports to maximize benefit

for all • Ensure classroom materials

(e.g., literature, posters, activities), **content**, and

activities validate and affirm diversity in the classroom

and community • Teach contributions of

individuals from all subgroups (e.g., race/ethnicity, language

status, gender, **disability** status) in **content** classes

• Consider task dimensions when planning **instruction**

(e.g., intersperse discussion during longer periods of

teacher **instruction**, provide a menu of choices to

demonstrate proficiency), and adjust task dimensions (e.g.,

reduce required number of problems, offer guided notes)

to accommodate unique needs and differentiate

supports to maximize benefit for all

Do not… • Use classroom materials,

**content**, or activities that only reflect the values and

experiences of one group • Emphasize “color blind”

approaches that ignore (and miss the opportunity to learn

about and celebrate) diversity • Use a one-size-fits all

approach to **instruction** that limits participation or benefit

of some members of the classroom community.

# Matrix of Practices to Actively Promote

# 2.1 Engage Students in Relevant ****Learning****

Actively engage students (provide high rates of varied opportunities to respond) in relevant learning,\* and differentiate **instruction** to support all learners †

• Use explicit **instruction** to

teach SEB and academic skills • Provide high rates of

opportunities for students to respond (e.g., asking a

question, requesting worked problem, providing writing

opportunity) • Vary response opportunities

to include: • Individual, small-group,

or whole group (choral or unison) opportunities

• Variety of response types (e.g., vocal, written,

electronic student response system,

response cards, white boards, guided notes,

gestures) • Differentiate to ensure

equitable benefit • Use model-lead-test (i.e.,

explicit “I do-we do-you do”) format to engage students in

**instruction** • Plan individual or small-group

questioning (e.g., randomly select a student to answer

after asking a question) • Use choral responding to

increase opportunities for all (e.g., all students read a

morning message, say letter sounds together)

• Also include nonverbal response opportunities (e.g.,

thumbs up if you agree, hold up certain fingers, show a

response card, use response apps)

• Differentiate by (a) pre- teaching, (b) adjusting rate, (c)

considering student response preferences, and (d) providing

a range of response options • Use model-lead-test (explicit

“I do-we do-you do”) format to engage students in

**instruction** • Plan individual or small-group

questioning (e.g., calling on randomly selected student to

explain example problem) • Use unison or peer-to-peer

responding to increase opportunities for all (e.g.,

share your thinking with your peer partner and be ready to

report back) • Also include nonverbal

response opportunities (e.g., hands up if you got 25 for the

answer, find a definition for “saturation point” online)

• Differentiate by (a) pre- teaching, b) adjusting rate, (c)

considering student response preferences, and (d) providing

a range of response options Do not…

• Use an instructional approach that assumes (rather than

assesses and/or teaches) prior learning and requires

students to figure out critical SEB or academic skills on

their own • Provide long duration

lecture without interspersing opportunities to respond

• Only ask for volunteers to respond to questions (instead

of distributing equitably and/or involving additional

students in each opportunity) • Rely exclusively on a single

approach (e.g., ask a question and wait for a verbal response

from one student) that limits opportunities for more

students to engage.

# Matrix of Practices to Actively Promote

# 2.2 Foster Positive Relationships

Greet and connect with each student\* and create opportunities to foster positive relationships among students, educators, and families†

• Positively greet each student

as they enter the learning **environment** (e.g., greet at

classroom door, login) • Provide structured and

unstructured opportunities for all students to engage

with each other—create specific opportunities for

students to practice SEB skills, communicate, and

develop positive relationships with peers

• Incorporate students’ preferences into learning

opportunities to increase connections during

**instruction** • Consider both verbal and

non-verbal interactions to foster positive relationships

• Monitor to ensure all students are included in

positive interactions • Offer students a choice

among fun greetings and greet each student into the

classroom—say their name, connect briefly on a shared

interest, and provide a brief prompt for expected SEB or

academic skill during/after transition

• Include peer-to-peer opportunities to engage in

cooperative learning activities and/or practice key SEB and

academic skills (e.g., peer tutoring, morning meeting)

• Include students’ ideas and preferences when

designing classroom décor, instructional activities, and

other fun experiences that foster connections among all

students and educators • Welcome each student into

learning **environment** by name, brief connection, and

reminder of next steps as they enter class

• While actively supervising (2.3), briefly interact with

students (e.g., ask how they are doing, comment, or

inquire about their interests; show genuine interest in their

responses) • Include opportunities for

peer-to-peer connection during academic routines

(e.g., cooperative problem- based learning, simulation

activities, debates, restorative circles)

• Co-design classroom **environment**, instructional

activities, and fun learning experiences

Do not… • Get stuck preparing materials,

responding to email, or engaging in other tasks when

students arrive in the learning **environment** (instead of

greeting each student) • Forget to facilitate peer-to-

peer connections • Design a classroom

**environment**, instructional activities, and other fun

experiences based solely on educator interests or

preferences • Leave some students out

by not fully addressing students preferences and

communication/SEB needs • Miss opportunities to

foster joy in learning and relationships with and among

students.

# Matrix of Practices to Actively Promote

# 2.3 Prompt and Supervise SEB and Academic Skills

Provide reminders or prompts to encourage skill use\* and actively monitor and supervise (move, scan, and interact) students’ use of SEB and academic skills†

• Prompt or remind students

of key SEB skills before skills are expected (e.g.,

start of activity) to increase the likelihood that students

use skills in the appropriate context

• Teach and emphasize self- managed prompts

• Actively monitor (check for understanding) and

supervise (move, scan, interact, proximity) during

all routines to (a) prompt SEB and academic skills,

(b) provide timely specific feedback, and (c) quickly

redirect contextually inappropriate behaviors (or

incorrect academic responses) to behaviors/skills that are

appropriate for current context (or correct)

• Provide individualized prompts to support students

with intensive needs • Use a range of approaches to

prompt, including visual (e.g., poster), gestural (e.g., point),

and verbal (e.g., “be **kind** by…); and briefly re-teach or

“pre-correct” to encourage key SEB and academic skills

• Teach students to use individualized picture

schedule to self-manage daily routines (e.g., move pictures

as they finish each activity) • Actively monitor students’

academic responses to adjust **instruction**

• Move around the classroom, scan for appropriate use of

SEB skills/behaviors, use proximity (e.g., move closer

to student’s desk), and brief interactions (prompt,

provide specific feedback) to encourage contextually

appropriate SEB skills/ behavior

• Model, practice, and provide feedback on students’

self-managed prompts to facilitate key routines (e.g.,

record a voice memo of key steps to locate classroom

website) or instructional activities (e.g., write

assignments in planner or electronic task management

system) • Review assignment

guidelines and criteria (e.g., rubric) before students begin

work and monitor students’ work to adjust support

• Actively supervise physical and virtual learning

environments to encourage (prompt and provide specific

feedback) contextually appropriate SEB skills/

behavior Do not…

• Wait until after a student makes a SEB error to remind

other students of SEB skill • Only remind students of what

not to do (e.g., no running) without also reminding

student what to do (e.g., please walk)

• Use supervision or proximity to intimidate or escalate

situations and/or to “patrol” students

• Interact only with some students (and not others)

• When monitoring, only provide corrections/

redirections and miss opportunities to provide

specific praise.

# Matrix of Practices to Actively Promote

# 2.4 Provide Specific Feedback

(≥5:1 raTio) Provide specific feedback contingent on students’ SEB and academic skills;\* give at least five positive praise statements for each 1 corrective statement (≥5:1 ratio)†

• Provide specific feedback to

encourage SEB and academic skills (specific praise) and decrease

errors (specific correction) • Effective specific praise

names the skill/behavior, provides sincere positive

feedback, and matches students’ preferences

• Effective specific corrections briefly signal

the error, quickly redirect to the contextually appropriate

skill, and may provide an opportunity to practice with

feedback; corrections are delivered privately in a calm

and supportive manner • Provide at least 5 praise

statements for every error correction (≥5:1 ratio);

increase this ratio for students demonstrating SEB risk (e.g., ≥9:1)

• Engage students in providing specific praise to each other

and themselves • Give specific praise to

recognize SEB skills (e.g., “Kind greeting!”), academic

skills (e.g., “Yes, great response!”), and contextually

appropriate behavior (e.g., “Nice walking.’)

• Provide a brief specific correction when a student

makes an academic error (e.g., “This sound is /a/, what

sound?” …later… ”Right, /a/!”) or SEB error (e.g., “Please

raise your hand before calling out your answer” …later…

”Respectful hand raise!”) • For students who may receive

more frequent corrections, intentionally increase praise

to ensure each student experiences ≥5:1 ratio of

positive to corrective feedback • Use a “praise around” for

students to practice providing praise to each other

• Give specific praise to recognize SEB skills (e.g.,

“Thanks for checking in!”), academic skills (e.g.,

“Well-argued point.”), and contextually appropriate

behavior (e.g., “Thanks for holding the door!’)

• Provide a brief specific correction

.... when a student

makes an error (e.g., “Please revise your response to

provide more detail.”) or SEB error (e.g., “Please stop playing

with lab equipment and keep it on the table” …later

“Thanks for being safe with the equipment”)

• Provide “wise” feedback‡ to support all students in

meeting high expectations • After teaching how to give

specific feedback, engage students in providing specific

feedback to each other and track their own positive to corrective

feedback ratio Do not…

• Rely on general praise statements (e.g., “Great job!

Super! Wow!”) that miss the opportunity to tag the

appropriate skill/response • Praise some, but not all,

students on a regular basis • Provide more error

corrections than praise statements

• Use harsh or escalating error correction (i.e., power

struggle) • Use sarcasm or insincere

feedback (e.g.., “Thank you for trying to act like a human.”)

• Assume all students like public praise—review praise

preferences (Table 1.2) and consider private feedback

when appropriate.

# Matrix of Practices to Actively Promote

# 2.5 Consider Other ****Response**** Strategies

Consider implementing a continuum of strategies to acknowledge/encourage SEB skills\* and respond to SEB errors†

• Adopt procedures that

celebrate, acknowledge, and reinforce (increase) use

of SEB skills, academic skills, and contextually appropriate

behavior; for example, consider: • ******Teacher******-student game or

good behavior game • Group contingency

• Token economy • Adopt procedures that

prevent or respond instructionally, respectfully,

and supportively to SEB errors, academic errors, and

contextually inappropriate behavior; for example, consider:

• Non-contingent reinforcement (NCR: e.g.,

**attention** or breaks) • Differential reinforcement

(DR) of alternative or low rates of behavior

• Self-management (SM) • Consider a group

contingency: If all students hand in homework

by the due date, next Friday we will play State Bingo instead of

having a formal test review.” • Consider a token economy:

“Thanks for working quietly on math for 10 minutes—very

responsible! You earned a point!”

• Consider NCR: Schedule breaks during challenging

routines (NCR: breaks) • Consider DR: During a

whole-group activity, James calls out (without raising hand).

The teacher ignores the call out, models a hand raise, and

immediately gives **attention** (calls on and praises) when

James raises his hand (DR of alternative behavior)

• Consider SM: Teach students to set goals, self-monitor SEB

skills, and celebrate when they meet goals

• Consider a group contingency: “If we generate

five examples of “Synthesis” in 5 min, you can sit where

you like for the last 20 min of class.”

• Consider a token economy: “Each studentwho participated

earned a penny toward our service learning project goal.”

• Consider NCR: During active supervision, briefly chat

with students on a regular schedule (NCR: **attention**)

• Consider DR: During a private conversation, educator says, “I

value your ideas, but we need your peers to also have a turn. If

you can share 3 ideas and save the rest, I’d love to meet with

you to talk about the rest of your ideas.” (DR of low rates

of behavior) • Consider SM: Teach students

to set goals, self-monitor SEB skills, and celebrate when

they meet goals Do not…

• Use systems that make corrections public (e.g., clip

charts) • Make the goal (criterion for

reinforcement) unattainable (e.g., all students will display

perfect behavior all year), use a reward you cannot deliver

(e.g., day off on Friday), or publicly address a student

making an error • Use rewards to encourage

students to engage in behaviors that are not in their

best interest • Forget to teach students

how the system (e.g., token economy, group contingency)

works.

# Strategies to Monitor Fidelity & Use Data to Guide Implementation

# 3.1 Monitor Educator Implementation

Monitor educators’ fidelity of implementation for key practices (tables 1 and 2)\*

• Measure fidelity, or the extent to

which key practices (Table 1 and Table 2) are implemented as recommended

• Use measures of implementation quantity (e.g., direct count of

practices) and quality (e.g., ratings of implementation effectiveness)

• Monitor equitable use of practices among all subgroups of students (race/

ethnicity, gender, language status, **disability** status)

• Obtain multiple perspectives (e.g., self, peer, mentor/coach,

administrator, student) when assessing implementation

• Monitor across time to continue to enhance implementation

• Gather feedback on social validity, including the cultural and contextual

relevance, of implementation • Use a brief assessment or

observation tool to efficiently monitor implementation of skills

• Collect direct counts to monitor implementation fidelity and equitable

use of specific and discrete skills (e.g., specific praise)

• Monitor implementation of an evidence-based program (e.g.,

packaged social skills or academic curriculum) using intervention-specific

fidelity checklists • Develop a responsive data collection

schedule that prioritizes monitoring implementation fidelity and equitable

use (a) at regular intervals (e.g., beginning, middle, end of semester),

(b) when experiencing implementation challenges, and/or (c) when trying to

establish habits of new or difficult practices

Do not… • Rely exclusively on perception data

rather than direct measures of implementation

• Only collect aggregate data (e.g., total counts, without considering student

subgroup) and assume implementation is equitable

• Use data in purely evaluative approach, rather than using data in supportive

approach to train, coach, and celebrate educators’ implementation

• Measure fidelity only at one point in time (e.g., annual evaluation), rather

than monitoring implementation across time

• Miss opportunities to reflect on social validity, including cultural

and contextual relevance, of implementation

# Strategies to Monitor Fidelity & Use Data to Guide Implementation

# 3.2 Access Training, Coaching, And Feedback

• Access resources that provide

information on key practices and explicit training that includes

opportunities to practice with feedback • Arrange coaching from self, peer, or

mentor/coach that provides prompts for key practices and opportunities for

in-vivo modeling if needed to enhance implementation

• Prioritize wellness and access supports as needed

• Arrange supportive data-based feedback from self, peer, or mentor/

coach that provides specific data about implementation and suggestions for

maintaining or achieving effective implementation of practices

• Celebrate implementation successes • Use self-management: Set goal

for implementation rates of key skill (e.g., praise), review graph (e.g.,

Be+, spreadsheet) to self-evaluate implementation (determine if goal was

met), and celebrate implementation successes

• Ask peer to observe implementation of key practices (e.g., take data on

ratio of specific positive to corrective feedback), praise strengths, and

suggest strategies to enhance implementation

• Request support from mentor or coach to (a) facilitate training, prompting, and/

or supportive databased feedback; (b) identify  to support wellness,

(c) problem solve implementation challenges, and/or (d) celebrate

implementation successes • Provide high rates of positive

specific feedback to staff regarding implementation efforts

Do not… • Only focus on deficits in

implementation, without also highlighting and celebrating strengths

• Set unrealistic expectations for self or others (e.g., “perfect” implementation)

• Recommend necessary improvement in the context of evaluative feedback

(e.g., annual evaluation) without providing support

• Use implementation performance to embarrass or reprimand educators

• Design a training, coaching, and feedback plan that is not (a) feasible

within existing  or (b) culturally and contextually relevant.

# 4.1 Monitor ****Student**** Outcomes

\* Monitor students’ SEB growth, disaggregate data by subgroup, and use data to guide response to students’ SEB needs & promote skill growth

• Operationally define student outcomes

(behavior/skill) in observable, measurable, and specific terms

• Select the appropriate data collection strategy, given features of the

behavior/skill and context: • Counting (frequency or rate)

• Timing (duration, latency, inter- response time)

• Sampling (time-based estimates) • Other descriptive methods (e.g.,

ABC recording, rating scales, extant data, student self-report)

• Disaggregate data by subgroup (race/ ethnicity, gender, language status,

**disability** status) to monitor equitable outcomes

• Review outcome data to determine whether students are (a) engaging

in SEB and academic skills and contextually appropriate behavior,

(b) showing on-going SEB needs and contextually inappropriate

behaviors, and/or (c) experiencing disproportionate levels of

exclusionary discipline • Use counting for behaviors that are

discrete, countable, and consistent (e.g., raising hand, talking out)

• Use timing for behaviors that are discrete (clear beginning and end)

and directly observed; for example, how long (a) a student spends walking

around the classroom (duration of out of seat), (b) it takes a student to begin

working after work is assigned (latency to on task), and (c) it takes a student

start the next problem after finishing the last one (inter-response time)

• Use sampling for skills/behaviors that are not discrete (unclear when

behavior begins or ends), countable (occur too rapidly to count), or

consistent (e.g., variable duration); for example, estimate of how often

a student is off task (percentage of observed intervals off task)

• Use other descriptive methods to capture additional features of

the context (e.g., antecedents, consequences) or students’

experiences (e.g., climate ratings, self- reported data)

Do not… • Collect outcome data without first

operationally defining the outcome to be measured

• Choose a data collection strategy that is not matched to relevant aspects of

the skill/behavior or context • Rely solely on perception data to make

decisions about student outcomes • ******Assume that****** an overall average

is representative of all students’ performance without disaggregating

data by subgroup • Use performance data to blame or

punish students and/or families.

# Positive Behavioral Interventions & Supports (PBIS)

# 4.2 Enhance Tier 1

• If review of student outcome

data indicate that many students are continuing to

demonstrate risk or need, enhance implementation of

Tier 1 (i.e., practices in Table 1 and Table 2)

• Enhance cultural responsiveness of

implementation • Implement neutralizing

routines to respond instructionally and equitably

to SEB errors • Further differentiate

implementation to meet the needs of all learners,

including students with **disabilities**

• Enhance Tier 1 to support common needs of students

who experienced crisis (e.g., natural disaster, school

violence, pandemic) • Revisit each practice example

in Tier 1 (Table 1 and Table 2) and enhance or double down

on prevention (e.g., enhance communication routines with

students and families, reteach expectations) and support

(e.g., consider additional strategies to acknowledge

students’ SEB or academic skills and contextually

appropriate behavior) • If one or more student groups

are not benefiting, enhance cultural responsiveness

of implementation (e.g., engage families in improving

relevance of reading materials, expectations, and

classroom activities) • Consider how to further

differentiate (e.g., increase dosage, improve specificity;

modify modality, plan praise) to maximize benefit for all

students • Revisit each practice example

in Tier 1 (Table 1 and Table 2) and enhance or double down

on prevention (e.g., enhance communication routines with

students and families, reteach expectations) and support

(e.g., consider additional strategies to acknowledge

students’ SEB or academic skills and contextually

appropriate behavior) • If key student groups are

not benefiting, revisit cultural responsiveness of

implementation (e.g., engage students in revisiting what

is, and what is not, working in the classroom; co-develop

an enhanced approach to **instruction** and support)

• Consider how to further differentiate (e.g., increase

dosage, improve specificity, modify modality, plan praise)

to maximize benefit for all students

Do not… • Assume a one-size-fits-all

approach to Tier 1 will be effective

• Make decisions about how to enhance practices in isolation,

without engaging students, families, and other members

of classroom community • Assume students need

targeted (Tier 2) or intensive (Tier 3) support if many

students continue to demonstrate need and/or

if educator implementation fidelity has not been

monitored (Table 3) • Withhold or delay referral for

special education evaluation for a student demonstrating

significant need.
