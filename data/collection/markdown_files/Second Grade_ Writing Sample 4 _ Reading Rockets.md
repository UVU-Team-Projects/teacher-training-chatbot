# Context of writing

A second grade girl wrote this story in a writing workshop where she was given free choice of topics.

# What is this child able to do as a writer?

She has generated an idea to write about that she feels strongly about. She sticks to the topic.

She shows an awareness of an audience by asking a question to her reader (‘Have you ever heard of a dog ers?’).

She uses conventions such as capital letters and ending punctuation for most sentences.

# Transcript

My dog Wendy is up to my knees. I teach her how to jump through a

hulahoop. I can also hide somewhere in my house and say OK. Wendy is 8 years old. She likes to go on walks. And when we go to my sister’s track

or cross country parties she likes to come. She is a cocker spaniel with big floppy ears. Wendy has a friend named Bear too. Have you ever heard of

dog years? Well, in dog years my dog is about 60 years old.

# What does this child need to learn next?

This child has a lot to say about her topic, but she is having difficulty organizing her ideas. She

jumps around between describing her dog and telling about fun things she likes to do with her dog. She could benefit from learning how to group similar sentences into paragraphs and learning

how to sequence important story events. She may want to reread her piece and sort her sentences into those that describe her dog and

those that tell what she likes to do with her dog. She could use one highlighter color for one topic and another highlighter color for the other topic. Then, she could rewrite her piece with all of one

topic in one paragraph and the other topic in a second paragraph. The teacher could show her, and the rest of the class, how to write a topic sentence for each paragraph. The teacher could use

her sentences as the mentor text and the class could generate several topic sentences for her to choose from.

The paragraph hamburger strategy could **help** her organize her ideas around a topic sentence and supporting details.
