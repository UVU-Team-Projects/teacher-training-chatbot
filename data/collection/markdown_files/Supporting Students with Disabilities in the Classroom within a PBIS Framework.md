# Positive Behavioral Interventions & Supports (PBIS)

# Supporting Students with Disabilities in the vClassroom within a PBIS Framework

# Introduction

Fortunately, decades of research demonstrate that when educators implement positive, proactive, and

evidence-based practices within a Positive Behavioral Interventions and Supports (PBIS) framework, students

experience (a) improved academic, social-emotional, and behavioral outcomes and (b) reduced exclusionary

and reactive discipline (Algozzine & Algozzine, 2007; Bradshaw et al., 2008; Bradshaw et al., 2009;

Bradshaw et al., 2010; Bradshaw et al., 2012; Horner et al., 2009; Lassen et al., 2006). Within a PBIS

framework, educators implement universal practices (Tier 1) to support all students, targeted practices

(Tier 2) for students who require an enhanced level of support to experience success, and intensive and

individualized practices (Tier 3) for students with more significant or chronic levels of need.

Practitioners may question where students with **disabilities** “fit” within multi-tiered frameworks, like

PBIS (Chan et al., 2018; McIntosh & Goodman, 2016). By legal definition, students with **disabilities** require

specially-designed **instruction** documented in an individualized education program. Therefore, we hear

common misrules or “myths” in the field, including (a) special education is Tier 3 or (b) students in special

education require only Tier 3 supports to be successful (IDEA, 2004). In reality, students with **disabilities** may

receive and benefit from supports within each tier, including Tier 1.

# Core Features

There are four core feautres of implementing PBIS to support all students, including students with **disabilities**, in classroom settings: (1) , (2) integrate classroom practices, (3) tier 1 is

for all, and (4) all means all.

# Invest in Prevention

Within each classroom, effective educators support and respond to student behavior

1 by (a) implementing Tier 1 foundation, prevention, and response practices

and (b) using data to guide their implementation and differentiation of practices (Office of Special ****Education****

Programs [OSEP], 2015). Positive Behavioral Interventions & Supports (PBIS)

In particular, educators: • emphasize positive and proactive practices,

• respond to challenging behavior with an instructional focus (i.e., teach and strengthen

social, emotional, and behavioral skills to replace the challenging behavior), and

• minimize their use of exclusionary and reactive discipline.

# Integrate ****Classroom**** Practices

Further, within each classroom, educators integrate effective academic and behavior support

to increase the likelihood that all students, including students with **disabilities**, benefit from classroom supports.

# Tier 1 is for All

Effective educators design, implement, and differentiate Tier 1

practices to meet the needs of the majority (>80%) of their learners. Thus, when learners

have more intensive needs, educators intensify their Tier 1 practices—they may provide more explicit social

skills **instruction**, frequent prompts or reminders, engaging **instruction**, opportunities for reinforcement,

and specific instructional feedback for academic and social behavior at an intensity that meets the needs of

at least 80% of students in their classroom or school. For students who continue to require additional

support to be successful, educators may layer on additional Tier 2

or Tier 3 supports; however, all students continue to receive Tier 1 support.

# All Means All

To increase likelihood of equitable outcomes with Tier 1 practices, effective educators engage students

and families in selecting, implementing, and adjusting practices to consider cultural and contextual factors

that may affect teachers’ implementation, students’ experiences and outcomes, and other key factors

that contribute to the discipline gap. Educators also intentionally implement key practices to increase equity within classrooms.

# Intervention Strategies

# Core Features

Guided by the above , effective educators implement the following “top ten” intervention

strategies to support and respond to student behavior in their classroom.

# Design and Adapt The Physical Environment of the ****Classroom**** to Meetthe Needs of All Students.

To support all students, consider (a) mobility around

and access to all areas of the classroom, (b) visual supports for students, and (c) assistive technology

and other supports to promote learning within the classroom **environment** (Archer & Huges, 2011; Wong

& Wong, 2009).

# Develop and Explicitly Teach Predictable ****Classroom**** Routines to Maximize Students’ Ability to Independently Navigate the ****Classroom****

To increase the likelihood that all students benefit from

predictable classroom routines, 9 explicitly define and

teach the routine, review and re-teach on a regular schedule, and provide and gradually fade prompts until

students are able to independently navigate classroom routines (Kern & Clemens, 2007).

# Post, Define, and Teach 3-5 Positive ****Classroom**** Expectations

Engage students in defining and positing a small number of positively stated expectations, and ensure

posted expectations are accessible to learners from a variety of language and ability backgrounds. To

maximize efficiency, explicitly teach expectations in the context of classroom routines, leveraging the planned

schedule for reviewing, re-teaching, and fading prompts to also teach expectations (Alter & Haydon,

2017).
# Promote Active ****Engagement**** with High Rates of Opportunities to Respond.

All students, across all grades and **content** areas,

benefit from engaging **instruction** that includes high quality, high rate, and varied opportunities to respond

(Alter et al., 2011; Partin et al., 2010; Sutherland et al., 2003). To increase engagement opportunities

for all students, consider incorporating instructional and assistive technology (Hirsch et al., 2019) and

other empirically-supported strategies to increase opportunities to respond.

# Provide Prompts, Pre-Corrections, and Other Reminders to Set Students Up for Success

Simple strategies, like providing “positive greetings at

the door” (i.e., connect with each student as they

enter the classroom, prompt routines and expected behavior, and provide specific praise for transition),

result in positive outcomes for all students, including students with **disabilities** (Allday & Pakurar, 2007;

Allday et al., 2011; Cook et al., 2018).

# Engage in Active Supervision to Monitor ****Student**** ****Behavior****

By engaging in active supervision

that is, moving around the classroom, scanning frequently, and

interacting with students—educators promote contextually appropriate behavior and prevent or

reduce contextually inappropriate behavior (Colvin, Sugai, Good, & Lee, 1997; DePry & Sugai, 2002).

# Deliver ****Behavior**** Specific Praise and Other Strategies to Acknowledge ****Behavior**** That is Appropriate for the Context

Specific praise “tags” a contextually appropriate

behavior with a positive statement (“Thank you for participating respectfully.”) and results in an increase in

desired behavior for most students (Floress, Beschta, Meyer, & Reinke, 2017). Supplement specific praise

with additional strategies to acknowledge student behavior (OSEP, 2015).

# Provide ****Behavior**** Specific Error Corrections and Other Strategies to Respond Instructionally to ****Behavior**** That is Inappropriate for the Context

Specific error corrections 13 signal an error, share how

to correct the behavior in the future, and provide an opportunity to practice and receive praise for the

contextually appropriate behavior. When needed, supplement this approach with additional strategies to

respond to contextually inappropriate behavior.

# Ensure Each ****Student**** Experiences a Favorable Ratio of Positive to Negative Interactions (e.g., Praise to Corrections)

As highlighted in national news, 14 all students benefit

when they experience more positive than negative feedback, and this is especially true for students with

**disabilities** who may require even more favorable ratios (as high as 9:1) to experience benefit (Caldarella et al.,

2019; Downs et al., 2019).

# Collect And Use Fidelity and Outcome Data to Guide Implementation and Differentiation of Practices

Educators use data to evaluate their own implementation fidelity and students’ outcomes

(indicating responsiveness to classroom practices). Based on data, educators may (a) adjust or differentiate

Tier 1 supports or (b) layer on additional Tier 2 or Tier 3 supports to meet the needs of all.

# The Bottom Line

All students, including students with **disabilities**,

benefit from effective implementation of empirically- supported practices within a PBIS framework.
