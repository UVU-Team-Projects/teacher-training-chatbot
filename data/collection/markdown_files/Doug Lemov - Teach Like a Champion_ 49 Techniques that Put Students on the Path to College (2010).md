# Teach Like a Champion: 49 Techniques that Put Students on the Path to College

# Chapter one

# Setting high Academic Expectations

One consistent ﬁnding of academic research is that high expectations are the most

reliable driver of high student achievement, even in students who do not have a history of successful achievement. Much of this research has been conducted

to test, conﬁrm, or debunk the famous “Pygmalion” study in which teachers were told that randomly selected groups of students had been proven through

testing to be on the brink of great academic gains. Those groups of randomly selected students in fact outperformed other randomly selected groups whose

teachers had not been led to expect great things, presumably because of those expectations.

****One of the problems**** with ﬁndings about high expectations is that they often include in the deﬁnition a wide array of actions, beliefs, and operational strategies.

One study deﬁned high expectations as including the decision to allocate and protect more time on task in academic subjects. That’s certainly good policy,

but from a research standpoint, it’s hard to disaggregate the effect of more time on task from expectations. It’s also hard to turn that into speciﬁc action in the

classroom. So what are the concrete actionable ways that teachers who get exceptional

results demonstrate high expectations? This chapter looks at ﬁve, derived from Teach Like a Champion

these teachers, that raise expectations and differentiate great classrooms from the merely good ones.

# Technique 1

# No opt out

One consistency among champion teachers is their vigilance in maintaining the

expectation that it’s not okay not to try. Everybody learns in a high-performing classroom, and expectations are high even for students who don’t yet have

high expectations for themselves. So a method of eliminating the possibility of opting out—muttering, “I don’t know,” in response to a question or perhaps

merely shrugging impassively in expectation that the teacher will soon leave you alone—quickly becomes a key component of the classroom culture. That’s where

No Opt Out started, though as with so many of the other techniques in this book, it soon found additional applications as a useful tool for helping earnest, striving

students who are trying hard but genuinely don’t know the answer. No Opt Out helps address both. At its core is the belief that a sequence beginning with a

student unable (or unwilling) to answer a question should end with that student giving the right answer as often as possible, even if it is only to repeat the correct

answer. Only then is the sequence complete.

# Key idea

# No opt out

A sequence that begins with a student unable to answer

a question should end with the student answering that question as often as possible.

In its simplest form, No Opt Out might look like this. It’s the ﬁrst day of school, and you’re reviewing multiplication facts with your ﬁfth or perhaps sixth

graders. You ask Charlie what 3 times 8 is. Glancing brieﬂy and impassively at you, Charlie mutters, “I dunno,” under his breath, then sucks his teeth, and turns

Setting High Academic Expectations 29 Reluctant students quickly

come to recognize that ‘‘I don’t know’’ is the Rosetta

stone of work avoidance. his head slowly to look out the window.

It’s a critical moment. Students all too commonly use this approach to push

back on teachers when their unwilling- ness to try, a lack of knowledge, or

a combination of the two makes them unsure or resistant. And all too often it

works. Reluctant students quickly come to recognize that “I don’t know” is the Rosetta stone of work avoidance. Many teachers simply don’t know how to

respond. The result is a strong incentive for students to say, “I don’t know” when asked a question. If you don’t feel like working hard, those three words

can save you a lot of effort. So if Charlie successfully shows you that you can’t make him participate, it’s going to be a long year of you gingerly (and weakly)

stepping around him, of other students seeing that Charlie does what he wants, and of Charlie not learning—a lose-lose-lose situation.

If you used No Opt Out in this situation, you would turn to another student, Devon, and ask him that same question. Assuming he correctly answered 24,

you’d now turn back to Charlie: “Now you tell me, Charlie, what’s 3 times 8?” Charlie has just found—without your stopping for a time-consuming and possibly

ineffective lecture—that he has to do the work anyway in your class. Later we’ll look at more challenging contingencies that you may be wondering about: What

if Charlie doesn’t answer when you come back to him? What if Devon doesn’t answer? For now, it’s most important just to understand the power and necessity

of coming back to a student who won’t try. The moment when you circle back and ask the student to reanswer the original question is the No Opt Out.

No Opt Out proves to be just as powerful in situations where students are trying. Here’s an example from Darryl Williams’s classroom, in which a student,

James, was unable to identify the subject of the sentence, “My mother was not happy.” He ﬁrst tried to guess: “Happy?” he asked. Williams persevered,

repeating the question as many other teachers would do: “What’s the subject?” However, as the student was still unable to answer, Williams now asked the

class, “When I am asking you for the subject, what am I asking for?” The student he called on now replied, “You’re asking for who or what the sentence

is about.” Returning to James, Williams repeated, “When I ask for the subject, I am asking for who or what the sentence is about. What’s the subject?” James

now answered correctly: “Mother.” As in all other No Opt Outs, the sequence began with a student unable to answer and ended with him providing the answer.

The second student’s answer didn’t replace the original student’s; it supported Teach Like a Champion

it. And James has seen himself succeed where just moments ago he was unable to. He has rehearsed success and practiced one of the fundamental processes of

school: get it wrong; then get it right. But let’s return now to some thoughts about what you might do if things

hadn’t gone so well. What if James still couldn’t answer, or worse, what if he had shrugged his shoulders and muttered, “I don’t know,” and with a bit of swagger.

If James still couldn’t answer, Williams might persist by asking another student, “Well, what does that mean the subject is?” The student having answered, “The

subject is mother,” Williams might then return to the original student asking him, “Okay, James, now you tell me: What’s the subject of the sentence?” With only

an answer to repeat, it’s all but impossible for James to opt out and maintain the useful illusion that he can’t answer. But in all likelihood, with any plausible

gray area removed (see the box), he will answer. If he doesn’t, it’s a case of deﬁance that you can address with a consequence and an explanation: “James,

you don’t have to get the answers right in my class, but you will be expected to try. I’ll see you here at recess.”

Much of student behavior is opportunistic and undertaken in reaction to the gray area, ‘‘I can get away with it, so I will.’’ A far smaller number of

students will persist in a behavior once you’ve made it unambiguous what you expect. Fewer still will do so when you’ve shown you’re persistent. This

is discussed further in What to Do. Even more effective might be a ﬁrmer iteration of No Opt Out before return-

ing to James: “Tell him again, David. What’s the subject?” And then, “Let’s try it again, James. What’s the subject of the sentence?” Or you could repeat the

answer yourself: “James, the subject of this sentence is mother. Now you tell me, what’s the subject?” Regardless of which approach you take, the sequence

ends with the original student repeating the correct answer: “The subject is mother.”

In the case of Charlie, if Devon didn’t answer and tried to mimic Charlie’s impassivity, you might give the answer yourself: “Class, 3 times 8 is 24. Devon,

what is it? Good. Now you, Charlie.” In a minute we’ll look at some of the more academically rigorous variations on No Opt Out. But ﬁrst I want to underscore

Setting High Academic Expectations 31 how the technique allows you to ensure that all students take responsibility for

learning. It establishes a tone of student accountability, and it honors and validates students who do know the answer by allowing them to **help** their peers in a

positive and public way. I also want to underscore that the worst-case examples I’ve given above

are fairly anomalous. The tone of No Opt Out in most classrooms is astound- ingly positive and academic. Using it empowers you to cause all students to take

the ﬁrst step, no matter how small. It reminds them that you believe in their ability to answer. And it results in students’ hearing themselves succeed and

get answers right. This causes them to grow increasingly familiar with success- ful outcome. No Opt Out normalizes this process with the students who need

it most.

# No opt out: clip 1

In clip 1 on the DVD, Darryl Williams of Brighter Choice Charter ****School****

for Boys in Albany, New York, demonstrates No Opt Out twice. In the ﬁrst instance, he calls on a student to read the word acted. When he isn’t

successful, Williams sticks with the boy, providing a cue himself until the student includes the sufﬁx. As Williams notes, the objective for the day’s

**lesson** is to read and understand sufﬁxes, so it’s probably worth taking the time to cue the student as he does.

In the second instance, when the student is unable to read the word performance, Williams calls on another student and then returns to the

original student: ‘‘Read it, Jamel.’’ In this case, it’s not probably worth the time to break down the error as the decoding skill the student struggles

with is less closely related to the day’s objective. That said, Williams has still ﬁrmly established a strong accountability loop.

There are four basic formats of No Opt Out. I’ve provided examples below, with each presented as a variation of the James sequence in Williams’s classroom.

What’s consistent across all four cases is that a sequence that begins with the student unable to answer ends with the student giving the right answer. This

ensures that everyone comes along on the march to college. Teach Like a Champion

• Format 1: You provide the answer; the student repeats the answer. ****Teacher****:

What’s the subject, James? James:

Happy. ****Teacher****:

James, the subject is mother. Now you tell me. What’s the subject? James:

The subject is mother. ****Teacher****:

Good, James. The subject is mother. • Format 2: Another student provides the answer; the initial student repeats

the answer. ****Teacher****:

What’s the subject, James? James:

Happy. ****Teacher****:

Who can tell James what the subject of the sentence is? ****Student**** 2:

Mother. ****Teacher****:

Good. Now you, James. What’s the subject? James:

The subject is mother. ****Teacher****:

Yes, the subject is mother. A variation on this method is to ask the whole class, rather than one individual

student, to provide the correct answer (using Call and ****Response****, technique 23 in Chapter Four) and then have the initial student repeat.

****Teacher****: What’s the subject, James?

James: Happy.

****Teacher****: On the count of two, class, tell me what the subject of the sentence

is. One, two . . . Class:

Mother! ****Teacher****:

What is it? Class:

Mother! ****Teacher****:

James. What’s the subject? Setting High Academic Expectations 33

James: Mother.

****Teacher****: Good, James.

• Format 3: You provide a cue; your student uses it to ﬁnd the answer. ****Teacher****:

What’s the subject, James? ****Student**** 1:

Happy. ****Teacher****:

James, when I ask you for the subject, I am asking for who or what the sentence is about. Now, James, see if that can **help** you ﬁnd the

subject. James:

Mother. ****Teacher****:

Good, James. The subject is mother. • Format 4: Another student provides a cue; the initial student uses it to

ﬁnd the answer. ****Teacher****:

What’s the subject, James? James:

Happy. ****Teacher****:

Who can tell James what I am asking for when I ask for the subject?

****Student**** 2: You’re asking for who or what the sentence is about.

****Teacher****: Yes, I am asking for who or what the sentence is about. James,

what’s the subject. James:

Mother. ****Teacher****:

Good, James. The subject is mother. I use the word cue here to mean a hint that offers additional useful informa-

tion to the student in a way that pushes him or her to follow the correct thinking process. A hint, by contrast, could offer any information. If I ask, “Can anyone

give James a hint to **help** him ﬁnd the subject?” a student might say, “It starts

with the letter m.” This would surely **help** James guess the answer but doesn’t teach him anything that will **help** him next time.

When you ask your students to provide a cue, be sure to provide guidance as to what **kind** of cue would be useful. Three cues are particularly

useful: •

The place where the answer can be found: ‘‘Who can tell James where he could ﬁnd the answer?’’

• The step in the process that’s required at the moment:

‘‘Who can tell James what the ﬁrst thing he should do is?’’ •

Another name for the term that’s a problem: ‘‘Who can tell James what denominator means?’’

. So how should you go about deciding which type of No Opt Out to use?

As a rule of thumb, sequences in which students use cues to answer questions are more rigorous than those in which students merely repeat answers given by

others, and sequences in which students do more of the narration and intellectual work are generally preferable. At the same time, there’s no way to slow down

enough to cue every student in the most rigorous way toward the answer to every question that stumps somebody. You’d never get anything else done. And

if you do, you risk not only losing your momentum but you allow students to co-opt the **lesson** by constantly feigning ignorance and cleverly taking you

off task. In seeking to balance between providing cues (slow but rigorous) and providing answers (fast but more superﬁcial), you’ll probably ﬁnd it helpful to

go back to your objective. The closer the question you asked is to your **lesson** objective, the worthier of a slower and more cognitively rigorous No Opt Out

it probably is. If it’s a peripheral topic, speed through it by taking the right answer quickly from a peer, asking for a repeat of it by the original student, and

moving on. No matter what balance you strike, students in your classroom should

come to expect that when they say they can’t answer or when they answer incorrectly, there is a strong likelihood that they will conclude their **interaction**

by demonstrating their responsibility and ability to identify the right answer. Setting High Academic Expectations 35

# Technique 2

# Right is right

Right Is Right is about the difference between partially right and all-the-way

right—between pretty good and 100 percent. The job of the teacher is to set a high standard for correctness: 100 percent. The likelihood is strong that students

will stop striving when they hear the word right (or yes or some other proxy), so there’s a real risk to naming as right that which is not truly and completely

right. When you sign off and tell a student she is right, she must not be betrayed into thinking she can do something that she cannot.

# Key idea

# Right is right

Set and defend a high standard of correctness in your

classroom. Many teachers respond to almost-correct answers their students give in class

by rounding up. That is they’ll afﬁrm the student’s answer and repeat it, adding some detail of their own to make it fully correct even though the student didn’t

provide (and may not recognize) the differentiating factor. Imagine a student who’s asked at the beginning of Romeo and Juliet how the Capulets and Mon-

tagues get along. “They don’t like each other,” the student might say, in an answer that most teachers would, I hope, want some elaboration on before they

called it fully correct. “Right,” the teacher might reply. “They don’t like each other, and they have been feuding for generations.” But of course the student

hadn’t included the additional detail. That’s the “rounding up.” Sometimes the teacher will even give the student credit for the rounding up as if the student

said what he did not and what she merely wished he’d said, as in, “Right, what Kiley said was that they don’t like each other and have been feuding. Good

work, Kiley.” Either way, the teacher has set a low standard for correctness and explicitly told the class that they can be right even when they are not. Just as

important, she has crowded out students’ own thinking, doing cognitive work Teach Like a Champion

that students could do themselves (e.g., “So, is this a recent thing? A temporary thing? Who can build on Kiley’s answer?”).

When answers are almost correct, it’s important to tell students that they’re almost there, that you like what they’ve done so far, that they’re closing in on

the right answer, that they’ve done some good work or made a great start. You can repeat a student’s answer back to him so he can listen for what’s missing

and further correct—for example, “You said the Capulets and the Montagues didn’t get along.” Or you can wait or prod or encourage or cajole in other ways

to tell students what still needs doing, ask who can **help** get the class all the way there until you get students all the way to a version of right that’s rigorous

enough to be college prep: “Kiley, you said the Capulets and the Montagues didn’t get along. Does that really capture their relationship? Does that sound like

what they’d say about each other?” In holding out for right, you set the expectation that the questions you ask and

their answers truly matter. You show that you believe your students are capable of getting answers as right as students anywhere else. You show the difference

between the facile and the scholarly. This faith in the quality of a right answer sends a powerful message to your students that will guide them long after they

have left your classroom.

# See it in action: clip 2

# Right is right

In clip 2 on the DVD, Annette Rifﬂe of North Star Academy demonstrates

Right Is Right. She calls on a student to explain how the rules for ordered pairs on a coordinate grid work—that the x coordinate always come

ﬁrst. The student notes that the ‘‘x-axis has to come ﬁrst and then the y-axis.’’ Most teachers would call this answer correct, but Rifﬂe insists

on the student being all the way right and calling them the ‘‘x and y coordinates.’’ She has the student integrate the correct terms into her

answer by reanswering. This clip also shows the power of technique 32, SLANT (introduced in

Chapter Five), as the student tracks the speaker during her answer. Setting High Academic Expectations 37

Over the years I’ve witnessed teachers struggle to defend right answers. In one visit to a ﬁfth-grade classroom, a teacher asked her students to deﬁne

peninsula. One student raised his hand and offered this deﬁnition: “It’s like, where the water indents into the land.” “Right,” his teacher replied, trying to reinforce

participation since so few hands had gone up. Then she added, “Well, except that a peninsula is where land indents into water, which is a little different.”

Her reward to the student for his effort was to provide him with misinformation. A peninsula, he heard, is pretty much “where the water indents into the land”

but different on some arcane point he need not really recall. Meanwhile, it’s a safe bet that the students with whom he will compete for a seat in college are

not learning to conﬂate bays and peninsulas. A better response might have been, “A bay is what you call it when water

indents into land. But a peninsula is a land formation. Who can tell me what a peninsula is?” with the sequence ending with the **kind** of deﬁnition students

get when their teachers believe they are going to college: “A peninsula is a formation where land is surrounded on three sides by water. Write that down in

your notes, please. A peninsula is a formation where land is surrounded on three sides by water.”

Though as teachers we are the defenders of right answers, of the standards of correctness, there are in fact four ways in which we are at risk of slip-

ping in holding out for right and thus four categories within the Right Is Right technique:

1. Hold out for all the way. Great teachers praise students for their effort but never confuse effort with mastery. A right answer includes the negative sign

if a negative sign is warranted. There no such thing as “Right! Except you need a negative sign.” When you ask for the deﬁnition of a noun and get “a person,

place, or thing,” don’t do students the disservice of overlooking the fact that the answer is incomplete: a noun is a person, place, thing, or idea.

Simple, positive language to express your appreciation for what a student has done and your expectation that he or she will now march the last few yards

is often the best way to address such a situation and retain positive tone in your classroom. Here are some phrases to do that:

• “I like what you’ve done. Can you get us the rest of the way?”

• “We’re almost there. Can you ﬁnd the last piece?”

• “I like most of that . . . ”

Teach Like a Champion •

“Can you develop that further?” •

“Okay, but, there’s a bit more to it than that.” •

“Kim just knocked a base hit. Who can bring her home?” Another effective response is to repeat the student’s words back to him or

her, placing emphasis on incomplete parts if necessary: •

“A peninsula is water indenting into land?” •

“You just said that a noun is a person, place, or thing . . . ” •

“You just said that a noun is a person, place, or thing, but freedom is a noun, and it’s not exactly any of those three.”

• “You just said that ﬁrst you would solve the exponent and then you’d solve

what’s in parentheses.”

2. Answer the question. 

Students learn quickly in school that when you don’t know the right answer to a question, you can usually get by if you answer a different one, especially if you say something true and 

heartfelt about the

wider world. Can’t identify the setting in the story? Offer an observation about the theme of injustice in the novel instead: “This reminds me of something from

my neighborhood.” Most teachers can’t pass up a student’s taking on issues of justice and fairness, even if what they asked about was the setting. Over time,

students come to recognize this. If you’re a Right Is Right

teacher, though, you know that the ‘‘right’’ answer to any

question other than the one you asked is wrong.

If you’re a Right Is Right teacher, though,

you know

that the

“right” answer to any question other than the

one you asked is wrong and you’ll insist that the student answer the question you

asked, not the one she wished you asked or what she confused it for. You might

respond with something like, “We’ll talk about that in a few minutes, Daniella. Right now I want to know about the

setting.” Another situation in which students answer a question other than the one

you asked is when they conﬂate different types of information about a topic. For example, you ask for a deﬁnition (“Who can tell me what a compound

word is?”), and a student replies with an example (“Eyeball is a com- pound word!”). Or alternatively, you ask them to describe a concept (“When

Setting High Academic Expectations 39 we refer to the area of a ﬁgure, what are we talking about? Who can tell me

what area is?”) and a student replies with a formula to solve for the concept (“Length times width”). In the thick of the action, it’s easy to miss that these

are right answers but to the wrong question. And as you begin to listen for them, you’ll ﬁnd these kinds of exchanges far more common than you might

expect. If you ask students for a deﬁnition and get an example, try saying, “Kim,

that’s an example. I want the deﬁnition.” After all, knowing the difference between an example and a deﬁnition matters.

3. Right answer, right time. Students sometimes want to show you how

smart they are by getting ahead of your questions, but it’s risky to accept answers out of sequence. For example, when you are teaching students the series of steps

needed to solve a problem and a student you call on to provide step 3 gives the whole answer, you have a problem. Accepting her answer before you’ve shown

all the steps required deprives the rest of your students of a full understanding of the process. It’s tempting to think that it’s a good thing that the class is moving

ahead quickly, but it’s not. It’s one student. And besides, teaching a replicable, repeatable process is more important than teaching the answer to this problem.

So it cheats the class if you respond favorably to one student’s desire to move to the end. Instead, consider responding with something like, “My question wasn’t

about the solution to the problem. It was about what we do next. What do we do next?”

Alternatively, if you are asking what motivates a character’s actions at the beginning of a chapter, you might prepare to resist accepting or engaging an

answer that discusses—even very insightfully—the more dramatic events that conclude the chapter, especially if the point of the discussion of the ﬁrst part is

to better understand the ending when you get there. If it was really possible to jump ahead to the end and still understand the topic of the **lesson**, you might ask

yourself why you were teaching the ﬁrst part anyway! The answer, of course, is probably that the ﬁrst part is important. This argues for protecting the integrity

of your **lesson** by not jumping ahead to engage an exciting “right” answer at the wrong time.

4. Use technical vocabulary. Good teachers get students to develop effec- tive right answers using terms they are already comfortable with: “Volume is

the amount space something takes up.” Great teachers get them to use precise technical vocabulary: “Volume is the cubic units of space an object occupies.”

This response expands student vocabularies and builds comfort with the terms students will need when they compete in college.

# See it in action: clip 3

# Right is right

In clip 3 on the DVD, Jason Armstrong, a math teacher at Boston’s Roxbury

Prep Charter ****School****, models Right Is Right. In this **lesson**, he demonstrates three of the subtechniques in the ﬁrst two minutes of his **lesson** with a

group of sixth graders. It’s hard not to notice how his use of the techniques ratchets up the level of academic expectation quickly and decisively:

Armstrong: We’re going to do a couple of things with volume today. Then we’re going to practice volume and then surface area. Can

someone give me a deﬁnition for volume to get us started? Mark? Mark: Volume is length times width times height.

Armstrong: You’re telling me how we’re going to solve for volume. If you say ‘‘length times width times height,’’ you’re giving me a

calculation. What I want to know—and you probably know this too, Mark—is what volume is [a perfect example of answer my

question]. What is that amount? Yeritza? Yeritza: Volume is the amount of square cubes that takes up something.

Armstrong: Okay, but I want to reﬁne what you said—’’the amount of cubes.’’ What should we say? What’s the technical deﬁnition

instead of just cubes? What were you going to say, Wes? Wes: The amount of cubic inches that a rectangular prism or a three-

dimensional ﬁgure takes up. Armstrong: Right, any three-dimensional ﬁgure. But I don’t want to

just say cubic inches because it’s not necessarily inches. It could be feet; it could be centimeters; it could be yards . . . [Classic all

the way right here. So many teachers would have accepted these answers.]

Wes: Cubic units. Armstrong: [writing on the overhead] So the amount of cubic units

that an object takes up . . . and, Donte, I know you know the other word. What’s the other word for takes up?

Setting High Academic Expectations 41 Donte: Occupies.

Armstrong: Yes. Occupies. Volume is the amount of cubic units that an object occupies. [He caps it off by stressing the technical vocabu-

lary, occupies. Is it any wonder Armstrong’s students are among the top-scoring math students in the state of Massachusetts?]

# Technique 3

# Stretch it

When students ﬁnally get an answer all the way right, there’s a temptation, often

justiﬁed, to respond by saying “good” or “yes” or by repeating the right answer, and that’s that. Just as often, though, the learning can and should continue after a

correct answer has been given. So it’s great to remember to respond, as many of champion teachers do, to right answers by asking students to answer a different

or tougher question or by using questioning to make sure that a right answer is repeatable, that is, the student knows how to get similar right answers again and

again. The technique of rewarding right answers with more questions is called Stretch It.

# Key idea

# Stretch it

The sequence of learning does not end with a right answer;

reward right answers with follow-up questions that extend knowledge and test for reliability. This technique is especially

important for differentiating **instruction**. This technique yields two primary beneﬁts. First, by using Stretch It to

check for replicable understanding, you avoid falsely concluding that reliable Teach Like a Champion

mastery of material has been achieved without eliminating the possibility that luck, coincidence, or partial mastery led to a right answer to the question asked.

Second, when students have indeed mastered parts of an idea, using Stretch It lets you give them exciting ways to push ahead, applying their knowledge in

new settings, thinking on their feet, and tackling harder questions. This keeps them engaged and sends the message that the reward for achievement is more

knowledge. Asking frequent, targeted,

rigorous questions of students as they demonstrate mastery

is a powerful and much simpler tool for differentiating.

Incidentally, this also helps you solve one of the thorniest classroom

challenges: differentiating **instruction** to students of different skill levels. We’re

sometimes socialized to think we have to break students up into different instruc-

tional groups to differentiate, giving them different activities and simultane-

ously forcing ourselves to manage an overwhelming amount of complexity. Students are rewarded with a degree of

freedom that’s as likely to yield discussions of last night’s episode of Ameri- can Idol as it is higher-order discussions of **content**. Asking frequent, targeted,

rigorous questions of students as they demonstrate mastery is a powerful and much simpler tool for differentiating. By tailoring questions to individual stu-

dents, you can meet students where they are and push them in a way that’s directly responsive to what they’ve shown they can already do.

There are several speciﬁc types of Stretch It questions that are especially effective:

• Ask how or why. The best test of whether students can get answers right consistently is whether they can explain how they got the answer. Increasingly,

state assessments ask these questions explicitly—one more reason for you to ask students to practice narrating their thinking process.

****Teacher****: How far is it from Durango to Pueblo?

****Student****: Six hundred miles

****Teacher****: How’d you get that?

****Student****: By measuring three inches on the map and adding two hundred plus

two hundred plus two hundred. Setting High Academic Expectations 43

****Teacher****: How’d you know to use two hundred miles for each inch?

****Student****: I looked at the scale in the map key.

• Ask for another way to answer. Often there are multiple ways to answer a question. When a student solves it one way, it’s a great opportunity to make

sure they can use all available methods. ****Teacher****:

How far is it from Durango to Pueblo? ****Student****:

Six hundred miles ****Teacher****:

How’d you get that? ****Student****:

By measuring three inches on the map and adding two hundred plus two hundred plus two hundred.

****Teacher****: Is here a simpler way than adding three times?

****Student****: I could have multiplied 200 times 3.

****Teacher****: And when you do that you’d get what?

****Student****: Six hundred

****Teacher****: Very nice. That’s a better way.

• Ask for a better word. Students often begin framing concepts in the simplest possible language. Offering them opportunities to use more speciﬁc

words, as well as new words with which they are gaining familiarity, reinforces the crucial literacy goal of developing vocabulary.

****Teacher****: Why did Sophie gasp, Janice?

****Student****: She gasped because the water was cold when she jumped in.

****Teacher****: Can you answer with a word different from cold, one that shows how

cold it was? ****Student****:

Sophie gasped because the water was freezing. ****Teacher****:

Okay, how about using one of our vocabulary words? ****Student****:

Sophie gasped because the water was frigid. ****Teacher****:

Very nice. Teach Like a Champion

• Ask for evidence. As students mature, they are increasingly asked to build and defend their conclusions and support opinions from among multiple possible

answers. This is especially the case in the humanities. Who’s to say what the theme of the novel is, or what the author intended to show in a given scene? By

asking students to describe evidence that supports their conclusion, you stress the process of building and supporting sound arguments in the larger world,

where right answers are not so clear. You also give yourself grounds to avoid reinforcing poor but subjective interpretations, a task that is often challenging

for teachers. You don’t have to say you don’t agree, just ask for the proof. ****Teacher****:

How would you describe Dr. Jones’s personality? What traits is he showing?

****Student****: He’s spiteful.

****Teacher****: And spiteful means?

****Student****: Spiteful means that he’s bitter and wants to make other people

unhappy. ****Teacher****:

Okay, so read me two sentences from the story that show us that Dr. Jones is spiteful.

• Ask students to integrate a related skill. In the real world, questions rarely isolate a skill precisely. To prepare students for that, try responding to

mastery of one skill by asking students to integrate the skill with others recently mastered:

****Teacher****: Who can use the word stride in a sentence?

****Student****: “I stride down the street.”

****Teacher****: Can you add some detail to show more about what stride means?

****Student****: “I stride down the street to buy some candy at the store.”

****Teacher****: Can you add an adjective to modify street?

****Student****: “I stride down the wide street to buy some candy at the store.”

****Teacher****: Good, now can you add a compound subject to your sentence?

****Student****: “My brother and I stride down the wide street to buy some candy at

the store.” Setting High Academic Expectations 45

****Teacher****: And can you put that in the past tense?

****Student****: “My brother and I strode down the wide street to buy some candy at

the store.” ****Teacher****:

Those were very challenging questions Charles, and look how well you handled them!

• Ask students to apply the same skill in a new setting. Once students have mastered a skill, consider asking them to apply it in a new or more chal-

lenging setting: ****Teacher****:

So what’s the setting of our story? ****Student****:

The setting is in a town called Sangerville in the recent past. ****Teacher****:

Good. I notice that you remembered both parts of setting. Can you remember the setting of Fantastic Mr. Fox then?

****Student****: It was on a farm in the recent past.

****Teacher****: How do you know it was the recent past?

****Student****: They had tractors.

****Teacher****: Good. But what about movies? Do movies have a setting?

****Student****: Yes.

****Teacher****: Great. I’ll tell you a setting and you see if you can tell me the movie.

# Right is right and stretch it

In clip 4 on the DVD, Leah Bromley of North Star Academy demonstrates

Right Is Right and Stretch It. Asked to draw a conclusion from a set of data comparing slope with stream depth, a student in Bromley’s class

replies: ‘‘The different slope affects how deep the stream is.’’ Bromley notes that the answer is pretty close to correct but still holds out for more:

‘‘I need somebody who can make that more speciﬁc.’’ To be right in her Teach Like a Champion

class, students have to explain what the effect is: ‘‘The steeper the slope, the deeper the stream is.’’

Now that she’s gotten her class to a fully ‘‘right’’ answer, Leah begins asking a series of questions to stretch her students. First, ‘‘What’s the

opposite of that?’’ a question she asks to ensure that students can apply the same relationship in reverse, and then, ‘‘Now I want someone to take

this one step further and use the word erosion.’’ In this case, she asks students to upgrade with more rigorous vocabulary. Then after arguably

another Right Is Right (in which the answer has to be more concise to be right), she asks students to Stretch It again and explain why.

All of this cognitive work—explaining the opposite of the phe- nomenon, using better vocabulary to describe it, and explaining why—all

happen after she’s gotten a correct answer from her students. The right answer is just the beginning.

Stretch It asks students to be on their toes: to explain their thinking or apply knowledge in new ways. Just asking a quantity of tough questions isn’t

necessarily sufﬁcient. In one ﬁfth-grade classroom, a student was asked by her teacher to use the vocabulary word passion in a sentence. “I have a passion for

cooking,” she replied. “Who else can use passion in a sentence?” the teacher asked. “I have a passion for basketball,” answered a boy. The teacher accepted

with a nod where she might have stretched. Here was an opportunity to test whether the student really understood how to use the word or was just making a

rote copy of a previous example. The teacher might have asked the student to use the adjective form of passion. Instead, she simply asked, “Anyone else?” Four

or ﬁve students methodically used the same sentence structure but replaced the object noun with some other—“I have a passion for dancing,” “I have a passion

for riding my bike”—making it an exercise in banal copying of a basal concept, and, ultimately, low expectations.

Think of all the ways the teacher could have used Stretch It with her students at an equal or lesser cost of time than the activity she chose:

• “Can you rewrite your sentence to have the same meaning but start with the

word cooking?” •

“What’s the adjective form of passion? Can you rewrite your sentence using passion in its adjective form?”

Setting High Academic Expectations 47 •

“If Marie had a passion for cooking, what sorts of things would you expect to ﬁnd in her house?”

• “What would be the difference between saying, ‘I was passionate about cook-

ing,’ and saying ‘I was fanatical about cooking?’” •

“What’s the opposite of having a passion for something?”

# Technique 4

# Format matters

The complete sentence is the

battering ram that knocks down the door to college.

In school, the medium is the message: to succeed, students must take their knowl-

edge and express it in a variety of clear and effective formats to ﬁt the demands

of the situation and of society. It’s not just what students say that matters but

how they communicate it. The complete sentence is the battering ram that knocks down the door to college. The essays required to enter college (and every paper

written once there) demand ﬂuent syntax. Conversations with potential employers require subject-verb agreement. Use Format Matters to prepare your students

to succeed by requiring complete sentences and proﬁcient grammar every chance you get.

Teachers who understand the importance of this technique rely on some basic format expectations:

• Grammatical format. Yes, you should correct slang, syntax, usage, and grammar in the classroom even if you believe the divergence from standard is

acceptable, even normal, in some settings, or even if it falls within a student’s dialect—or more accurately, even if you perceive it to be normal within what

you perceive to be a student’s dialect. In fact, you may not know how a student’s family or community speaks or what it views as normal or acceptable. And there

is some history of young people adopting dialects or choosing to speak in a way different from the way their parents do or wish them to.

To gloss the vast sociological discourse on what’s standard, whether it’s the only right form of language and even whether it is in fact correct, champion

teachers accept a much more limited but practical premise: there is a language of opportunity—the code that signals preparedness and proﬁciency to the broadest

possible audience. It’s the code that shows facility with the forms of language Teach Like a Champion

in which work, scholarship, and business are conducted. In it, subjects and verbs agree, usage is traditional, and rules are studied and followed. If students choose

to switch and use the language of opportunity selectively and only in school settings, so be it. But no matter what you tell your students about how they talk

elsewhere, making the determination to prepare them to compete for jobs and seats in college by asking them to self-correct in class is one of the fastest ways to

**help** them. There may be a time and place in which to engage them in a broader sociological discourse on dialect—under what circumstances it can be acceptable

to use dialect, who determines correctness, how much subjectivity there is in that determination, what the broader implications of code switching are, and so on.

Given the frequency of very real errors by students and the potential cost to them of allowing those errors to persist, ﬁnd simple and minimally disruptive

techniques to identify and correct errors with minimum distraction. That way you can correct consistently and seamlessly. Two simple methods are especially

helpful: •

Identify the error. When a student makes a grammatical error merely repeat the error in an interrogative tone: “We was walking down the street?” “There

gots to be eight of them?” Then allow the student to self-correct. If the student fails to self-correct, use the next method or quickly provide the correct syntax

and ask him or her to repeat. •

Begin the correction. When a student makes a grammatical error, begin to rephrase the answer as it would sound if grammatically correct and then

allow the student to complete it. In the examples above, that would mean saying, “We were” or “It has to” and leaving the student to provide the full

correct answer. • Complete sentence format. Strive to give students the maximum amount

of practice building complete sentences on the spur of the moment. To do this, you can use one of several methods when students answer you in a fragment or

a single word. You can provide the ﬁrst words of a complete sentence to show students how

to begin sentences: ****Teacher****:

James, how many tickets are there? James:

Six. ****Teacher****:

There are . . . James:

There are six tickets in the basket. Setting High Academic Expectations 49

Another method is to remind students before they start to answer, as in: ****Teacher****:

Who can tell me in a complete sentence what the setting of the story is?

****Student****: The setting is the city of Los Angeles in the year 2013.

And a third is to remind students afterward with a quick and simple prompt using the lowest possible disruption, as in:

****Teacher****: What was the year of Caesar’s birth?

****Student****: 100 b.c.

****Teacher****: Complete sentence.

****Student****: Julius Caesar was born in 100 b.c.

Some teachers substitute a code such as “like a scholar” to remind students to use complete sentences. As in, “Who can tell me like a scholar?”

# See it in action: clip 5

# Format matters

In clip 5 on the DVD, Darryl Williams of Brighter Choice Charter ****School****

for Boys demonstrates Format Matters. In both cases, he actively reinforces the language of opportunity by correcting the phrases ‘‘It gots to be’’ and

‘‘It got a ‘–ed’.’’ Williams uses two strategies to do so. In the ﬁrst case, he ‘‘punches the error,’’ repeating, ‘‘It gots to be?’’ as a question and causing

the student to self-correct. In the second case, he provides a sentence stem, ‘‘It has . . . ,’’ which the student completes. In both cases, Williams is

effective in keeping his transaction cost low and maintaining a neutral and nonjudgmental tone.

• Audible format. There’s not much point of discussing answers with thirty people if only a few can hear you. If it matters enough to say in class, then it mat-

ters that everyone can hear it. Otherwise class discussion and student participation Teach Like a Champion

appear as afterthoughts, incidental banter. Underscore that students should be listening to their peers by insisting that their peers make themselves audible.

Accepting an inaudible answer suggests that what a student said didn’t matter that much.

Perhaps the most effective way to reinforce this expectation is with a quick, crisp reminder that creates the minimum distraction from the business of class.

Saying “voice” to students whose voice is inaudible, for example, is preferable to a ﬁve-second disruption such as, “Maria, we can’t hear you in the back of the

room. Would you speak up, please?” in three ways. First, it is more efﬁcient. In the language of business, it has a low transaction cost. It costs almost nothing

in terms of a classroom’s most precious commodity: time. In fact, a champion teacher can offer three or four reminders about “voice” in the time a less proﬁ-

cient teacher can remind one student in the style used with Maria previously. Transaction cost refers to the amount of resources it takes to execute an

exchange—be it economic, verbal, or something else. Your goal is to make each necessary intervention with the least distraction from the task at hand

and the least time away from what you were doing, and thus with the absolute minimum of words.

Second, merely stating “voice” as opposed to offering a long-winded expec- tation suggests that you don’t need an explanation for why you should speak up

in class. The reason is self-evident, and the reminder makes it clear that speak- ing up is an expectation, not a favor. Third, by telling the student what to do

as opposed to what she did wrong, the teacher avoids nagging, thus preserving her relationship with students and allowing her, if necessary, to remind often

enough to make the expectation predictable and thus most effective in changing behavior.

This last point deserves some ampliﬁcation. Once several colleagues and I watched a teacher’s **lesson**. Four or ﬁve times during that **lesson**, the teacher

reminded students to speak audibly but used the term louder as a reminder rather than the word voice. Her use of louder seemed to emphasize a lack of something;

it constantly emphasized that expectations were not being met and thus “narrated the negative,” an idea you will read about in Positive Framing (technique 43

in Chapter Seven). “Voice,” by contrast, reinforces an expectation in a quick Setting High Academic Expectations 51

reminder that tells students what to try to achieve. My colleagues also noted that some teachers used the term voice with a ﬁnesse that was not achievable with

the term louder, for example, “Jayshon, can you use your voice to tell me how I’d ﬁnd the least common multiple?” or “I need someone with voice to tell me

what I need to do next!” My colleagues and I concluded that voice is the gold standard when working

on audible format. • Unit format. In math and science class, replace “naked numbers” (those

without units) with ones that are “dressed.” If you ask for the area of a rectangle and a student tells you it’s twelve, ask for the units, or merely note that her

numbers “need some dressing up” or “look a bit underdressed.”

# Key idea

# Format matters

It’s not just what students say that matters but how they

communicate it. To succeed, students must take their knowl- edge and express it in the language of opportunity.

# Technique 5

# Without apology

Sometimes the way we talk about expectations inadvertently lowers them. If

we’re not on guard, we can unwittingly apologize for teaching worthy **content** and even for the students themselves. You won’t do this when you use Without

Apology.

# Apologies for **content**

When I returned to campus my junior year after studying abroad, I got last

pick of the English electives and found myself in Professor Patricia O’Neill’s class on British romantic poets. I couldn’t imagine anything less interesting and

Teach Like a Champion considered various forms of drastic action: Change majors? Find a very pow-

erful dean somewhere and plead pathetically in various ways? Alas, I was too busy with the other pursuits of a distracted college student to follow through.

I thus backed in to the single most interesting and engaging class I took in college. Professor O’Neill somehow convinced me that the well-being of the

world urgently required me to stay up late reading William Wordsworth. She permanently changed the way I think and read. And imagine: if I’d been even

vaguely organized, I’d never have taken her class. I suspect most readers have had a similar experience, ﬁnding the thing that seemed least interesting became

life-changing in the hands of a **gifted** teacher. The **lesson**? There is no such thing as boring **content**. In the hands of a

great teacher who can ﬁnd the way in, the material students need to master to succeed and grow is exciting, interesting, and inspiring, even if as teachers we

sometimes doubt that we can make it so. And even if this doubt puts us at risk of undercutting it: watering it down or apologizing for teaching it. There are four

primary ways we are at risk of apologizing for what we teach: A belief that **content** is boring

is a self-fulﬁlling prophecy. .• Assuming something will be

boring. Saying something like, “Guys, I know this is **kind** of dull. Let’s just try

to get through it,” or even, “You may not ﬁnd this all that interesting,” is apol-

ogizing. Think for a minute about the presumption that your students will ﬁnd something boring, even if it is genuinely uninteresting to you. Thousands of

accountants love their job and ﬁnd it fascinating, whether or not anyone else thinks they’d like the work. Someone has awakened them to its rariﬁed joys.

Every year thousands of students take pride and joy in diagramming sentences. A belief that **content** is boring is a self-fulﬁlling prophecy. There are teachers

who make great and exciting and inspiring lessons out of every topic that some other teacher may consider a grind. Our job is to ﬁnd a way to make what we

teach engaging and never to assume that students can’t appreciate what’s not instantly familiar to them or what does not egregiously pander to them. Doing

so suggests only a small faith in the power of education. • Blaming it. A teacher who assigns the responsibility for the appearance

of **content** in her class to some outside entity—the administration, state ofﬁcials, or some abstract “they”—is blaming it. It sounds like this: “This material is on

the test so we’ll have to learn it.” “They say we have to read this so . . . ” If it’s “on the test” it’s also probably “part of the curriculum” (though the later is a

less emotionally charged way of thinking about it). And a better way to address Setting High Academic Expectations 53

it is to assume it’s part of the curriculum for a reason and start by reﬂecting on that rationale.

• Making it “accessible.” Making material accessible is acceptable— preferable, even—when it means ﬁnding a way in, that is, ﬁnding a way to

connect kids to rigorous college prep **content**; it’s not so great when it dilutes the **content** or standards. It’s okay to use a contemporary song to introduce the

idea of the sonnet. It’s not okay to replace sonnets with contemporary songs in your study of poetry. Here are some alternatives to apology:

• “This material is great because it’s really challenging!”

• “Lots of people don’t understand this until they get to college, but you’ll

know it now. Cool.” •

“This can really **help** you succeed” [for example, “by helping you understand how sentences work”].

• “This gets more and more exciting as you come to understand it better.”

• “We’re going to have some fun as we do it.”

• “A lot of people are afraid of this stuff, so after you’ve mastered it, you’ll

know more than most adults.” •

“There’s a great story behind this!” Content is one of the places that teaching is most vulnerable to assumptions

and stereotypes. What does it say, for example, if we assume that students won’t be inspired by books written by authors of other races? Or by protagonists of

different backgrounds than their own? More speciﬁcally what does it say if we are more likely to assume those things about minority students? Do we

think that great novels transcend boundaries only for some kids? Consider the novelist Earnest Gaines’s description of the authors who inspired him to write.

Gaines, who wrote several of the most highly acclaimed novels of the twentieth century, including Autobiography of Miss Jane Pittman, A ****Lesson**** Before Dying,

and A Gathering of Old Men, grew up poor in rural Louisiana on the same land his family had share-cropped for generations, He was the eldest of twelve children

and was raised by his aunt—the **kind** of kid to whom some might ascribe a limited worldview, probably without asking, and to whom few would assign

a diet of nineteenth-century Russian novelists. Yet Gaines recalls: “My early inﬂuences were . . . the Russian writers such as Tolstoy, Turgenev and Chekhov.

I think I’ve also been inﬂuenced by Greek tragedy, but not by Ellison and any black writers. I knew very early what it was I wanted to write. I just had to ﬁnd

out a way to do it and the . . . writers whom I’ve mentioned showed me this way.” Teach Like a Champion

Let me say that I love Ellison, just as I love Gaines, and am not suggesting we not teach his work (to all students incidentally). But imagine the loss not

just to Gaines but to all of us if the teacher who ﬁrst put Turgenev in his hands and inspired the spark of genius to grow into a ﬂame had looked at the color of

his skin, assumed that Gaines wouldn’t ﬁnd interest in anything so foreign, and thought better of Turgenev.

# Apologies for students

Assuming something is too hard or technical for some students is a dangerous

trap. At the ﬁrst school I founded, the inner-city students we enrolled learned Mandarin Chinese as their foreign language. Not only did outsiders react with

shock (“You’re going to teach those kids Chinese???”), but sometimes so did their parents (“She’s not gonna sit through that”). But millions of people, most

of them far poorer than our poorest student, learn Chinese every year. And in the end every student did learn Chinese, much to their and their parents’ enjoyment.

There’s a special pleasure in exploding expectations, and many of the black and Hispanic students in the school took special pleasure in using their Chinese

exactly when people around them least expected it. This offers a reminder not to assume there’s a “they” who won’t really “get” something, say sonnets and other

traditional forms of poetry, and that it’s therefore better to teach them poetry through hip-hop lyrics instead. What happens when they take Introduction to

Literature in their freshman year in college and have never read a poem written before 1900? Kids respond to challenges; they require pandering only if people

pander to them. The skill of not apologizing for students is critical not only in the intro-

duction and framing of material but in reacting to responses to it. Sticking with kids, telling them you’re sticking with them, and constantly delivering the mes-

sage, “But I know you can,” raises a student’s self-perception. Here are some alternatives to apologizing:

• “This is one of the things you’re going to take real pride in knowing.”

• “When you’re in college, you can show off how much you know about . . . ”

• “Don’t be rattled by this. There are a few fancy words, but once you know

them, you’ll have this down.” •

“This is really tricky. But I haven’t seen much you couldn’t do if you put your minds to it.”

Setting High Academic Expectations 55 •

“I know you can do this. So I’m going to stick with you on this question.” •

“It’s okay to be confused the ﬁrst time through this but we’re going to get it, so let’s take another try.”

# Reflection and practice

The chapter presented ﬁve techniques for raising academic expec- tations in your classroom: No Opt Out, Right Is Right, Stretch It,

Format Matters, and Without Apology. Which of these will be the most intuitive for you to implement in your classroom? Which will

be the toughest, and what will make it difﬁcult? 2.

There are variety of reasons that a student might opt out of answering a question you asked—for example:

• A student is actively testing or defying you.

• A student is trying not to stand out in the classroom.

• A student genuinely does not know the answer.

• A student is embarrassed to not know the answer.

• A student didn’t hear you when you asked.

• A student didn’t understand what you asked.

See how many possible reasons for a No Opt Out you can add to this list. How should the breadth of possible reasons listed cause

you to consider or adapt the tone with which you engage students when you use No Opt Out?

3. One of the keys to responding effectively to ‘‘almost right’’ an-

swers—reinforcing effort

but holding

out for

top-quality answers—is having a list of phrases you think of in advance. After

reﬂecting on which of the following phrases most match your style as a teacher, try to write four or ﬁve of your own.

• ‘‘I like what you’ve done. Can you get us the rest of the way?’’

• ‘‘We’re almost there. Can you ﬁnd the last piece?’’

• ‘‘I like most of that.’’

Teach Like a Champion •

‘‘Can you develop that further?’’ •

‘‘Okay, but there’s a bit more to it than that.’’ •

‘‘Satish just knocked a base hit. Who can bring him home?’’ 4.

Here’s a list of questions you might hear asked in a classroom and the objective for the **lesson** in which they were asked:

• 6 + 5 = ? Objective: Students will be able to master sim-

ple computations: addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division.

• Who can use the word achieve in a sentence? Objective: Stu-

dents will be able to increase their vocabulary through drills that explore the use of synonyms, antonyms, and different

parts of speech. •

What do you think is the **lesson** of ‘‘The Three Little Pigs’’? Objective: Students will be able to explore the moral of the

story and the genre of fables in general. •

What is one branch of the U.S. government? Objective: Stu- dents will be able to understand the three branches of the U.S.

government and how they relate to each other and current events.

Try to think of ten Stretch It questions you might ask for the one that’s closest to what you teach. (This is a great activity to do with

other teachers.) 5.

Format Matters: Next time you’re observing a peer’s class, guess how many times you will hear answers that are given:

• In a single word or with a sentence fragment

• In ungrammatical syntax

• Inaudibly

Then count how many times they actually occur during your obser- vation. Was the number more or less than you expected? Why?

6. Without Apology: Try to imagine the most ‘‘boring’’ **content** (to

you) that you could teach. Now script the ﬁrst ﬁve minutes of your class in which you ﬁnd a way to make it exciting and engaging to

students. .

# Chapter two

# Planning that Ensures academic Achievement

The ﬁve planning techniques in this chapter are designed to be implemented

before you walk in the door of your classroom. They are a bit different from the other techniques in this book in that they are not for the most part executed live

in front of students. Few people will see you do them. But they set the stage for your success once you do walk in the door so they are inexplicably linked to the

rest of the techniques you’ll ﬁnd in this book. To state the obvious, these ﬁve speciﬁc types of planning are critical to effective teaching.

# Technique 6

# Begin with the end

When I started teaching, I would ask myself while I planned, “What am I going

to do tomorrow?” The question revealed the ﬂaws in my planning method in at least two critical ways—even without accounting for my sometimes dubious

answers to the question. The ﬁrst ﬂaw was that I was thinking about an activity for my classes on

the following day, not an objective—what I wanted my students to know or be able to do by the end of the **lesson**. It’s far better to start the other way

around and begin with the end, the objective. By framing an objective ﬁrst, you Teach Like a Champion

substitute, “What will my students understand today?” for, “What will my stu- dents do today?” The ﬁrst of these questions is measurable. The second is not.

The only criterion that determines the success of an activity is not whether you do it and people seem to want to do it, but whether you achieved an objective

can be assessed. Instead of thinking about an activity, perhaps, “We are reading To Kill a Mockingbird,” framing your objective forces you to ask what your

students will get out of reading the book. Will they understand and describe the nature of courage as demonstrated in To Kill a Mockingbird? Will they under-

stand and describe why injustice sometimes prevails as demonstrated in To Kill a Mockingbird? Or perhaps they’ll use To Kill a Mockingbird to describe how

important characters are developed through their words and actions. Why are you teaching the

material you’re teaching? What’s the outcome you

desire? How does this outcome relate to what you’ll

teach tomorrow and to what your students need to have

learned to be ready for the fourth or eighth or tenth

grade? In short, there are lots of worthwhile

things you can do in class and lots of ways you can approach each of them.

Your ﬁrst job is to choose the rationale that is most productive: Why are you

teaching the material you’re teaching? What’s the outcome you desire? How

does this outcome relate to what you’ll teach tomorrow and to what your stu-

dents need to have learned to be ready for the fourth or eighth or tenth grade?

The second ﬂaw in my question was that I was usually asking it the

night before

the class. Beyond

the obvious procrastination that implies, it

shows that I was planning my lessons singly, each **lesson** vaguely related to the previous perhaps, but not reﬂecting an intentional progression in the purpose of

my lessons. Of the two ﬂaws, this was actually the more damning. I could cure the procrastination issue by planning all of my lessons the Friday before, say,

but until I began to think of my lessons as parts of a larger unit that developed ideas intentionally and incrementally toward mastery of larger concepts, I was

sure to be treading water. In fact, I would have been better off planning all of my objectives (only) for the trimester in advance and then procrastinating the

planning of each **lesson** than I would have been dutifully planning a batch of activity-driven lessons the week before.

Great lessons begin with planning, and speciﬁcally with effective unit plan- ning: planning a sequence of objectives, one or possibly two for each **lesson**,

Planning that Ensures Academic Achievement 59 over an extended period of time (say, six weeks). Unit planning means method-

ically asking how one day’s **lesson** builds off the previous day’s, prepares for the next day’s, and how these three ﬁt into a larger sequence of objectives that

lead to mastery. Logically, then, it also implies that if you know you’ve failed to achieve full mastery of one day’s objective, an objective on which tomorrow’s

depends, you must go back and reteach the **content** to ensure full mastery before moving on. To be sure of mastery, great Begin with the End teachers often

begin lessons by circling back to anything they’re not sure the class mastered the day before.

The unit planning process is followed by **lesson** planning, which consists of: 1.

Reﬁning and perfecting the objective based on the degree to which the objec- tive the day before was mastered

2. Planning a short daily assessment that will effectively determine whether the objective was mastered 3.

Planning the activity, or, more precisely, a sequence of activities, that lead to mastery of the objective

Using this **lesson** planning sequence—objective, assessment, activity— disciplines your planning. It helps ensure that your criterion will not be, “Is my

**lesson** creative?” or “Does it employ enough of the right strategies?” but, “Will it be the best and fastest way to **help** me reach the goal?”

Don’t underestimate how critical this is. The prevalence of ﬂawed **lesson** criteria is a major issue in teaching. Teachers care about earning the respect and

admiration of their peers, and when teachers praise each other for their lessons, they are as likely as not to praise an artful, clever design or the loyal use of

recommended methods such as group work, whether or not they yield results. Having effective **lesson** criteria (“Did this **lesson** accomplish the goal?”) allows

you to constantly evaluate and reﬁne your strategy and technique, rather than ﬂying blind.

To sum, Begin with the End means: 1.

Progressing from unit planning to **lesson** planning 2.

Using a well-framed objective to deﬁne the goal of each **lesson** 3.

Determining how you’ll assess your effectiveness in reaching your goal 4.

Deciding on your activity Teach Like a Champion

# Technique 7

# 4 ms

Given the importance of objectives in bringing focus, discipline, and measurabil-

ity to a **lesson**, it’s important to think about what makes an objective useful and effective. My colleague Todd McKee artfully designed four criteria for effective

objectives, the 4 Ms, and if you’re able to ensure that your objectives meet those criteria, your chances of starting with an effective goal are high.

Effective objectives should be: • Manageable. An effective objective should be of a size and scope that

can be taught in a single **lesson**. It’s not that you don’t want your students to master the broad, rich, deep, and critically important skill of making character

inferences, for example, but setting the goal that students will learn to make strong character inferences in a single hour’s practice is patently unrealistic.

Actually it requires weeks to establish a ﬁrm basic mastery. You’d want to revisit it constantly thereafter to build depth and context into your students’ skill

and to give them lots of practice. One of the most common misconceptions about objectives is that they preclude you from talking about other things during

class. Of course, you should take time to discuss how you’d make effective inferences to better understand the nature of a character in a story during your

lessons working toward mastery of theme, plot, use of evidence, and so forth. In fact, doing so, and knowing that your students can do so, should reinforce your

effectiveness in achieving those goals. Knowing how fast they can

master information means knowing whether you need

two or three weeks to master the basic skill.

Given the importance of character inference, a key part of the process nec-

essary to do it justice is to conceptualize in your own mind the steps necessary

to achieve mastery. You will have to do different things each day so that your

students will master the skill. Perhaps you’ll start by identifying words and

actions that provide evidence of charac- ter, then practice interpreting them singularly, then practice assembling evidence

and examining multiple pieces of it at once. Or perhaps you’ll want to start with inferences about simple, stock characters and work your way up to more com-

plex, nuanced ones. Either way, it would be a mistake to use the same broad Planning that Ensures Academic Achievement 61

objective every day for three weeks while you “work on” the skill. You would have a much greater chance of success if you built a series of day-by-day objec-

tives that set achievable goals for each day. Not only would you make your work more strategic, but you’d also gain a better and better sense for what your stu-

dents could accomplish in a day. Knowing how fast they can master information means knowing whether you need two or three weeks to master the basic skill.

• Measurable. An effective objective should be written so that your success in achieving it can be measured, ideally by the end of the class

period. This lets you better understand in your own mind what worked in your implementation. The best teachers take this opportunity to the next logical step:

they measure every **lesson** with an exit ticket (a short activity, question, or set of questions that students must complete and leave with you before departing;

see technique 20 in Chapter Three). Even if you don’t use exit tickets, setting an explicit measurable goal beforehand helps you hold yourself accountable.

Finally, setting measurable **lesson** objectives disciplines you in other ways. For example, it forces you to think through key assumptions. If your goal is to

have students know something or understand something or think something, how will you know they have reached it? Thoughts are not measurable unless they

are described or applied. Does your **lesson** include that? Do your lessons rely on a balance of methods for describing or applying understanding? Furthermore, if

your goal is to have students feel, think, or believe something, how appropriate is that? Is it sufﬁcient to be able to read and understand poetry without enjoying,

appreciating, or loving it? Are students accountable for learning skills that can **help** them make up their own minds or for accepting the judgments and tastes

of others? I am a pretty fair case study of this. Although I have a master’s degree in

English literature, I do not enjoy reading poetry. In fact I usually ﬁnd it almost unreadable. I’m sorry to say (to all my fantastic professors and teachers) that I

have almost never achieved the objective of loving a poem. Nevertheless, having learned to analyze and sustain arguments about poetry, and having had to critique

those of others, has helped me to become a more effective thinker and writer and occasionally (very occasionally, my wife might argue) a more insightful

person. So in the end, I am truly glad to have studied and read poems in my literature classes. My point is that my best teachers held themselves accountable

for what they could control (the quality of my thinking and sustainability of my arguments), not what they couldn’t (whether I liked reading the stuff). Even

though their love for the things they taught me was probably their reason for doing the work, passing that love on to me fell into the realm of what they

Teach Like a Champion couldn’t control and so they eschewed it as their objective even if it was their

motivation—an irony, to be sure, but a useful one. • Made First. An effective objective should be designed to guide the activ-

ity, not to justify how a chosen meets one of several viable purposes. The objective comes ﬁrst. The rationale for this is described in Begin with the End.

Be aware, however, of just how many teachers who believe they are objective driven start with an activity (“We’re playing Jeopardy today!” “We’re reading

I Know Why the Caged Bird Sings today”) and retroﬁt an objective to it. You can often tell these teachers because their objectives look like learning standards

(which are different and far broader) and are occasionally written on the board undigested from state documents: “3.L.6 Students will read a variety of texts for

understanding.” To risk beating a dead horse, you must digest the standard into a strategic series of daily objectives to ultimately achieve its broader mastery by

mastering a series of component pieces. • Most Important. An effective objective should focus on what’s most

important on the path to college, and nothing else. It describes the next step straight up the mountain.

# Key idea

4MS

As my colleague Todd McKee puts it, a great **lesson** objec- tive (and therefore a great **lesson**) should be manageable,

measurable, made ﬁrst, and most important on the path to college.

The following objectives fail to meet at least one of the 4M criteria: • Students will be able to add and subtract fractions with like and unlike

denominators. This objective isn’t manageable. It contains at least four different objectives for four different days (and more likely four different weeks): adding

fractions with like denominators, subtracting fractions with like denominators, Planning that Ensures Academic Achievement 63

adding fractions with unlike denominators, and subtracting fractions with unlike denominators. Realistically, this objective is a standard, a huge one, and the topic

of a unit plan. • Students will be able to appreciate various forms of poetry, including son-

nets and lyric poetry. What is appreciation? How will you know whether it happened? Can students understand T. S. Eliot and not like his writing, or do they

have to pretend to assimilate your tastes as well? This objective isn’t measurable. It’s probably not manageable either.

• Students will view scenes from the ﬁlm version of The Crucible. This objective is an activity, not an objective. Therefore it’s not made ﬁrst. Showing

the ﬁlm version of Arthur Miller’s play The Crucible could be a home run or a waste of time, depending on what its purpose is. Will students compare

the ﬁlm version of The Crucible to Elizabeth George Speare’s The Witch of Blackbird Pond? If so, why? To learn what? Will they compare the portrayal of

colonial witchcraft in the two stories? If so, with what purpose? For example, will students better understand Speare’s perspective on witchcraft by comparing

it to another contemporary story? If so, that should be described in the objective: To better understand the author’s perspective on witchcraft in colonial America

by comparing her portrayal to another contemporary portrayal. • Students will construct a poster to celebrate Martin Luther King Jr. Day.

This objective isn’t “most important.” Skill at making posters won’t **help** put students in a position to succeed through the **content** of their character. Under-

standing Dr. King’s legacy certainly is deeply important, and that understanding might even be reﬂected in a poster, but a champion teacher would consider poster

making useful only if it was the best way to reinforce that understanding. The objective should be about Dr. King.

# Technique 8

# Post it

Once your objective is complete, Post It in a visible location in your room—the

same location every day—so everyone who walks into the room, your students as well as peers and administrators, can identify your purpose for teaching that

day in as plain English as possible. Teach Like a Champion

In the case of students, posting your objective is important because they should know what they’re trying to do. Awareness of this fact will **help** them

work more intentionally toward the goal. In the example of The Crucible, students will watch better if they know what they’re looking for. You can go a step further

by making the objective part of the fabric of the classroom conversation. You can underscore its importance by asking students to discuss, review, copy, or read it,

as a matter of habit, at the outset or at the conclusion of the **lesson**. You might even make a habit of asking your students to be able to put the objective in con-

text, to say why it matters, to connect it to what happened yesterday, and so on. Visitors give you feedback,

and feedback is more useful when the person giving it

knows what you’re trying to do—if they address not just

whether your teaching was ‘‘good’’ in some abstract

sense, but whether it appeared to be getting you

to your goal. In the case of visitors, for example,

your fellow teachers or your supervisor, it’s important because visitors give you

feedback, and feedback is more useful when the person giving it knows what

you’re trying to do—if they address not just whether your teaching was “good”

in some abstract sense, but whether it appeared to be getting you to your goal.

A visitor who thinks you should be dis- cussing more about how the characters

are developed in the Crucible may or may not be right. Whether you should

spend more time on the development of characters depends on what your pur-

pose is, and it’s to your beneﬁt to discipline those who **help** you to focus on what best accomplishes the task as well. Otherwise, their advice and evaluation

of your **lesson** fall to idiosyncratic criteria. Your department chair observes you and says you should be emphasizing character development more because, in the

end, that’s what she does with the Crucible.

# Technique 9

# Shortest path

When you can think of more than one possible activity to achieve an objective,

your rule of thumb should be something like Occam’s razor: “All other things being equal, the simplest explanation or strategy is the best.” Opt for the most

direct route from point to point, the Shortest Path to the goal. Eschew the Planning that Ensures Academic Achievement 65

complex if something less clever, less cutting-edge, less artfully constructed will yield a better result. Use what the data tell you works best, but when in doubt

rely on proven, direct, trustworthy methods, especially I /We/You (see Chapter Three). This seems obvious, but in a profession where teachers for years had

become accustomed to ﬂying blind—that is, not having objective criteria with which to measure the effectiveness of their lessons—a culture of nonmastery-

based criteria emerged: How clever, how artfully designed, how enjoyable to teach, how inclusive of various state-of-the-art philosophies is the **lesson**? If you

listen carefully, you will hear constant implicit and explicit reference to such criteria in the discussions of teachers: “I loved your **lesson**; the stations were so

well designed, and there was so much peer **interaction**.” The assumption in such a statement is that both of those things are inherently positive in their own right,

whether they best achieve the goal and whether they make achieving the goal take twice (or half) as long.

Again, the criterion is mastery of the objective and what gets you there best and fastest. Group work, multisensory approaches, open inquiry, Socratic

seminars, discussions, and lectures are neither good nor bad for a teacher to use except in how they relate to this goal. Take the shortest path, and throw out all

other criteria. Shortest Path does not necessarily mean that the shortest path you choose

is a approach sustained for forty-ﬁve minutes or an hour or an hour and twenty minutes. Champion teachers are generally inclined to make their lessons motivat-

ing by switching among a series of reliable activities with a variety of tones and paces, a method discussed more fully in the section on pacing in Chapter Eight.

These can be energetic and spirited or reﬂective and deliberate, often within the same **lesson**. The terrain always changes, even on the shortest path between two

points.

# Technique 10

# Double plan

At its best, **lesson** planning is driven by an objective that’s part of a carefully

planned sequence of objectives. It determines how to assess the outcome before choosing activities to get from A to B. Good **lesson** planning also requires speci-

ﬁcity. Great teachers often plan their questions, and, like Julie Jackson at North Star Academy, they memorize them on their drive to school or their walk to class.

But there’s a ﬁnal element to effective **lesson** planning that’s often overlooked and especially powerful: Double Plan.

Teach Like a Champion Too often teachers forget to

plan what students will be doing each step of the way.

What will they be doing while you’re reviewing the primary

causes of the Civil War? Most **lesson** plans focus on what

you, the teacher, will be doing—what you’ll

say and

explain and

model, what you’ll hand out and collect and

assign. Too often teachers forget to plan what students will be doing each step

of the way. What will they be doing while you’re reviewing the primary

causes of the Civil War? Will they be taking notes? If so, where? On a blank

sheet of paper? On a graphic organizer you’ve designed? Will they then review those notes and write a quick one-sentence summary? While you “explain the

difference between prime and composite numbers” what will their task be? To listen carefully? To ﬁll in a T-chart? To try to remember three key differences?

To watch and listen but respond to occasional whole-class call and response questions (for example, “Prime numbers are not what, class?”)?

****Thinking**** about and planning for what students will do is critical. It helps you see the **lesson** through their eyes and keeps them productively engaged. It

helps remind you that it’s important to change pace occasionally during your **lesson** and for students to change pace, to get to do a variety of things during

a **lesson**—write, reﬂect, discuss. One way to start yourself thinking this way is to make a double plan: plan your lessons using a T-chart with “you” on one side

and “them” on the other. I don’t know many teachers who continue to plan this way once they’ve gotten in the habit (the “them” is embedded naturally in their

planning), but disciplining yourself to do it is a way to focus on keeping your students actively engaged.

# Key idea

# Double plan

It’s as important to plan for what students will be doing

during each phase of your **lesson** as it is to plan for what you’ll be doing and saying.

Planning that Ensures Academic Achievement 67

# Technique 11

# Draw the map

There’s a ﬁnal piece to effective planning that almost every teacher already uses.

The problem is that teachers sometimes forget they’re using it or use it once per year and then forget to adapt and adjust it. That piece is the planning and

controlling of the physical **environment**, which should support the speciﬁc **lesson** goals for the day rather than using the best approach to support the most **lesson** on

average or, worse, to support ideological beliefs about what classrooms should look like. I refer to it as Draw the Map.

Teachers in many classrooms seat their students in pods of desks that face each other because they believe that students should be socialized to interact in

school. This is a general (in fact, overgeneralized) belief about the nature and philosophy of schooling. With the exception of the fact that some teachers realign

desks for tests, this classroom layout often doesn’t change even if critical parts of the class period involve, say, taking notes on what the teacher writes on the

board. This often erodes outcomes. Though students should interact in school, the time when they are supposed to be constructing a record of key information

in writing may not really be the time for that. And with desks in pods, some percentage of students must now look over their shoulders to see the information

they are accountable for and then swivel to write it down in front of them. Furthermore, students now must ignore the student directly across from them to

attend to the teacher behind their back. If the teacher’s goal is to be attended to for much of the **lesson**, she has created a strong disincentive for that. The

classroom layout has made the primary **lesson** objective harder to accomplish in deference to philosophy.

What if, rather than asking whether students should interact in school or opining that they should, a teacher with this classroom layout asked:

• When should students interact in school?

• How should students interact in school? (There are lots of ways, and it doesn’t

take much imagination to realize it’s worthwhile to avoid conﬂating them.) •

What should the way students sit signal and incentivize about the various kinds of interactions?

• Which kinds of interactions support which kinds of **lesson** objectives?

• What other kinds of ways can students be socialized to interact appropriately

without necessarily building the classroom around that one idea every day? Teach Like a Champion

It might be that a teacher wants students facing each other only for some lessons. It might be that a teacher wants **interaction** for only part of the **lesson**.

It might be that asking students to turn to one another and discuss an idea will suitably accomplish the goal at exactly the moments when **interaction** is

warranted without structuring the classroom so that some student always have their backs to the teacher. I’m giving my own biases about classroom layout

away here, but you don’t have to agree with me to use the technique. Draw the Map means making space planning part of your **lesson** planning.

I am in fact a big fan of rows as the default classroom structure—speciﬁcally three paired columns of rows (see Figure 2.1), mostly because I see so many

teachers I watch use it. This layout is tidy and orderly and socializes students to attend to the board and the teacher as their primary focus. It allows teachers to

stand directly next to any student they want to or need to as they teach in order to check work or ensure being on task. It gives every student a place to write that

is directly in line between them and what they are supposed to be writing about in most cases. Teachers who want them to interact more directly ask students to

“track the speaker” (look at the person who’s talking) or have them turn their chairs accordingly or have them move their desks quickly to another formation.

Regardless of the layout you use, where the aisles and alleys are is at least as important as where you put the desks. You have to be able to get anywhere

in the room (preferably to within a foot of any student so you can whisper in his or her ear without leaning across anyone else) without a word—while you

are teaching, in fact. Once you have to say “excuse me” to ask students to

# Figure 2.1.

Paired Columns of Rows

Planning that Ensures Academic Achievement 69 push in a chair or resituate backpacks in order to get where you want to go,

you are essentially asking permission. You have to interrupt your **lesson** to be where you want. You have ceded control of and full natural access to parts of

the room. This will limit your ability to hold students to high behavioral and academic standards. So no matter what layout you choose, think as intentionally

about aisles and alleys as about desks. Finally, planning walls is important too. The ﬁrst rule of thumb for walls

in the best classrooms is that they should **help**, not harm. This means that they should avoid clutter and overstimulation. A few critical things should be up, and

they should not distract students’ **attention** from the primary instructional space by being too close to it. Posted items are best when they focus on useful tools:

reminders of key steps in adding fractions; examples of common themes; seven types of conﬂict in a story; pictures representing recent vocabulary words; rules

for bathroom use; phrase starters for agreeing or disagreeing with a peer during discussion. Once you’ve taught a key skill, posting a tool quickly after helps

students review it and use it frequently. Though most teachers are frequently told to post student work, posting tools like this is at least as important.

This doesn’t mean you shouldn’t also post student work. You should. But be sure to post work that is both exemplary and provides a model to other students.

Often there’s important work to be done in making this visible. Can you make comments on posted work speciﬁc and aligned to learning goals? Can you replace

writing “great job” in the margin with, “Great job starting your paragraph with a clear topic sentence,” or even “Great topic sentence—clearly previews the key

issue in the paragraph”? If you can, it will **help** make success replicable to other students.

# Reflection and practice

The following activities should **help** you think about and practice the

techniques in this chapter.

1. Choose an especially large learning standard from the state in which you teach. 
 
Try to guess before you analyze it how many

objectives you’d need to truly master it. Now break it up into a series of manageable, measurable objectives that ﬂow in a logical

Teach Like a Champion sequence from introduction of the idea to full mastery. Next, try to

increase or decrease the number of days you have available by 20 percent. How does this change your objectives?

2. Make a building tour of your school, writing down the objectives.

Score them as to whether they meet 4 Ms criteria. Fix the ones you can, and then ask yourself where as a school you need to improve

objective writing. 3.

Think of a recent **lesson** you taught, and write out all of the actions from a student’s perspective, starting in each case with an action

verb: ‘‘Listened to’’ and ‘‘Wrote,’’ for example. If you feel daring, ask your students if they think your agenda is accurate. Even more

daring is to ask your students to make a list of what they were doing during your class.

4. Make an action plan for your classroom setup:

a. What should your default layout be, and what would the most

common other layouts look like? Will you use them enough to justify having your students practice moving from one to

another? b.

What are the ﬁve most useful and important things you could put on the walls to **help** students do their work? Are they up?

c. What things are on your walls that don’t need to be? Nominate

ﬁve to take down. .

# Chapter three Structuring and Delivering your Lessons

There’s a consistent progression to the lessons of the champion teachers who

informed this book. It’s best described as “I/We/You.” (As far as I know, Doug McCurry, founder of Amistad Academy Charter ****School****, coined this phrase. Oth-

ers use the terms direct **instruction**, guided practice, and independent practice to describe what McCurry means.) This name refers to a **lesson** in which respon-

sibility for knowing and being able to do is gradually released from teacher to student. It means beginning with “I” by delivering key information or modeling

the process you want your students to learn as directly as possible, then walking your students through examples or applications. In the “We” step, you ﬁrst ask

for **help** from students at key moments and then gradually allow them to complete examples with less and less assistance on more and more of the task. Finally, in

the “You” step, you provide students the opportunity to practice doing the work on their own, giving them multiple opportunities to practice. Put another way,

I/We/You is actually a ﬁve-step process: Teach Like a Champion

Step ****Lesson****

Segment Who’s Got the

Football? Typical Statement

I I do.

“The ﬁrst step to adding fractions with unlike denominators is to make the

denominators equal.” We

I do; you **help**. “Okay, now let’s try it. How did we say

we were going to make our denominators equal, Martin?”

“Great, we’re starting to get this. There are ﬁve more in your packet. Take six

minutes and see how many you can get exactly right. Go!”

Note that the shift from one step to the next happens as soon as, but not before, students are ready to succeed given the additional independence. It’s not

necessarily better to get to the We and the You as fast as you can. Getting there too soon will slow you down in the long run.

The recipe may sound obvious to some, but it doesn’t happen this way in many classrooms. Often students are released to independent work before

they are ready to do so effectively. They are asked to solve a problem before they know how to do it on their own. They’re asked to infer the best

solution by “inquiry” when they have little hope of doing so in an effective and efﬁcient way. In many cases, they independently and industriously practice

doing a task the wrong way. They reﬂect on “big questions” before they know enough to do so productively. In other classrooms, by contrast, students get very

good at watching their teacher demonstrate mastery without ever learning to do it on their own. There’s lots of hard work going on, but it’s all done by the

grown-ups. The answer, of course, is not to choose between the poles of direct **instruction** and independent thinking but to progress from one to the other.

Staging that progression is tricky work, though, and the key factors in design- ing an effective I/We/You **lesson** are not only the manner and sequence in which

Structuring and Delivering Your Lessons 73 the cognitive work is released to students, but also the rate at which the cognitive

work is released. This last part requires you to check frequently for understanding, a topic discussed in this chapter at some length.

# I/we/you: an overview

# I Techniques

• Technique 12—The Hook: When necessary, use a short, engaging

introduction to excite students about learning. •

Technique 13—Name the Steps: When possible, give students solution tools—speciﬁc steps by which to work or solve problems of the type

you’re presenting. This often involves breaking down a complex task into speciﬁc steps.

• Technique 14—Board = Paper: Model for students how to track the

information they need to retain from your lessons; ensure that they have an exact copy of what they need.

• Technique 15—Circulate: Move around the classroom to engage and

hold students accountable. Additional Thoughts About Good ‘‘I’’

• Include both modeling (showing how to do something) and explana-

tion (telling how to do something). •

Include student **interaction** even though you’re driving. (You can still ask questions and engage in dialogue with students during ‘‘I.’’)

• Anticipate: ‘‘I knew I was becoming a teacher,’’ champion teacher Kate

Murray of Boston told me, ‘‘when I started being able to know in advance what my kids would do wrong, what the common mistakes

would be. I realized I could plan for that. I could tell them what was going to confuse them before they got there, so they would be alert

to the danger. I could keep them from getting tripped up or at least **help** them to recognize when it started to happen. From then on, my

planning process included a ‘what could go wrong’ conversation with myself. And I planned to preteach what I knew would be the pitfalls. I

put that right into my **lesson** plans.’’ Amen. Teach Like a Champion

‘‘We’’ Techniques •

Technique 16—Break It Down: One of the best ways to present material again is to respond to a lack of clear student understanding by breaking

a problematic idea down into component parts. •

Technique 17—Ratio: The goal of ‘‘we’’ is to push more and more of the cognitive work out to students. Feigned ignorance—’’Did I get that

right, you guys?’’ ‘‘Wait a minute, I can’t remember what’s next!’’—and unbundling—breaking one question up into several—can be especially

useful. •

Technique 18—Check for ****Understanding****: Used to determine when and whether students are ready for more responsibility and when they

need material presented again. ‘‘You’’ Techniques

• Technique 19—At Bats

• Technique 20—Exit Ticket

• Technique 21—Take a Stand

Some Thoughts on Effective ‘‘You’’ •

Repetition matters. Students need to practice over and over. Some of them learn the skill for good the third time they do it right; some

of them learn it the tenth time. Very few of them learn it the ﬁrst or second.

• Go until they can do it on their own. By the end of independent

practice, students should be able to solve problems to the standard they’ll be accountable for, entirely on their own.

• Use multiple variations and formats. Students should be able to solve

questions in multiple formats and a signiﬁcant number of plausible variations and variables.

• Grab opportunities for enrichment and differentiation. As some stu-

dents demonstrate mastery faster than others, be sure to have bonus problems ready for them to push them to the next level.

# Technique 12

# The hook

If you can introduce material in a way that inspires and excites and can get

your students to take the ﬁrst step willingly, then there is no **content** about which you cannot engender excitement, engagement, and deep learning among

your students. The way in is with The Hook: a short introductory moment that captures what’s interesting and engaging about the material and puts it out front.

It can be a brief story, a riddle, a picture of the thing you’ll be discussing in class. It brings Gregor Mendel’s pea plants to life and makes Newton’s second

law of motion seem like the most important thing in the world. The Hook is not a plan to water down material; rather, it prepares students to be brought

The way in is with The Hook: the short introductory

moment that captures what’s interesting and engaging

about the material and puts it out front.

up to the material. It’s not a **lesson**-long dog-and-pony show, not an hour of cir-

cumventing Romeo and Juliet to make it “contemporary” but the ﬁve minutes

that will open the doors of Elizabethan drama. You may not need The Hook for

every **lesson**, and you shouldn’t confuse length in time with effectiveness: a ten-

second hook can sufﬁce as well or better than a three-minute hook.

After watching dozens of teachers hook their students on every **kind** of **content** under the sun, I’ve broken the types of hooks into the following rough

categories, with the understanding that there are almost assuredly a thousand brilliant ideas for hook that don’t ﬁt any of the categories:

• Story. Tell a quick and engaging story that leads directly to the material. Bob

Zimmerli introduces long division with a story about a group of kids staying home without their parents and babysitting for themselves. The long division

sign is the house, and they huddle by the door as numbers approach and knock from the position of the divisor. The key moment (whether to open the door)

turns on the rules of divisibility. •

Analogy. Offer an interesting and useful analogy that connects to students’ lives, for example, as I recently observed a teacher do, comparing single

replacement bonds in chemistry to dancers choosing partners at the school dance.

Teach Like a Champion •

Prop. You can jazz up one of the other styles of prop with a good prop: a jacket like the one the main character in the story might have worn (or couldn’t have

worn: “Who can tell me why?!”); a globe and a ﬂashlight to demonstrate the earth’s rotation.

• Media. A picture or a piece of music or video (very short) can enhance your

hook when planned carefully to support and not distract from your objective. Or assume the role of a someone from the book or from history. Use this cau-

tiously as well. It too can be distracting and you can easily get carried away and waste time if you’re not disciplined!

• Status. Describe something great: great work by a student, the reasons that

Shakespeare is so highly regarded. Or mention that today you’ll begin read- ing the works of “the author many believe is the greatest of his generation,”

or “the greatest to write about war,” or “the greatest to write about love and relationships,” or “to write in the English language.”

• Challenge. Give students a very difﬁcult task, and let them try to accomplish

it. (“See if you can translate this line from Shakespeare into plain English!”) (An example follows.) If you can’t think of anything especially clever, a good

game of Pepper (technique 24 in Chapter Four) is great challenge and works perfectly. In fact, at several schools, teachers use Pepper as their default if a

more distinctive hook can’t be found. Here are two examples:

• On a recent September morning, Jaimie Brillante asked her students who knew

what a complete sentence was. All raised their hands. Great, she said and gave them ﬁve words, asking them to take two minutes to make a sentence out of

them, encouraging them to try to make the best sentence possible. As it turned out, the ﬁve words couldn’t be made into a complete sentence. After a few

minutes of wrestling with the brainteaser, Jaimie asked them to ﬁgure out what’s missing. The answer? A subject. The surprise of the unsolvable riddle

hooked her students for the hour to come. •

When Bob Zimmerli teaches place value to his ﬁfth graders, he weaves a story about a hypothetical friend of his named “Deci” though his **lesson**. The houses

on the right side of Deci’s house are named tenths, hundredths, and thou- sandths; those on the left side are ones, tens, and hundreds. There’s a story

about Deci walking down the block to get to a burger joint and passing the Structuring and Delivering Your Lessons 77

different houses on hundreds and thousands street, saying the names aloud as he goes. Before they know they’re learning math, his students are rapt.

Like these examples, a good hook typically has the following characteristics: •

It’s short. It’s the introduction, not the **lesson**, and it engages students in a few minutes.

• It yields. Once the ship is under sail, it quickly gives way to more the teaching

part of the **lesson**. •

It’s energetic and optimistic. It dwells on what’s great about Shakespeare, for example, not what’s hard or daunting or difﬁcult, unless that’s what’s great.

A ﬁnal thought on The Hook: you don’t need one for every **lesson**. Colleen Driggs likes to use The Hook on the ﬁrst **lesson** on a given topic. As she proceeds

through the often three or four subsequent lessons with objectives that develop and advance understanding of the topic, she turns to another technique. This

seems like an especially useful rule of thumb.

# Technique 13

# Name the steps

Why is it that the best coaches often rise from the ranks of the almost- or not-so-

great athletes, while the most **gifted** athletes rarely make the best coaches? Why is it that brilliant and sophisticated actors can’t **help** others do something similar

and are so often at a loss to describe how they do what they do? Meanwhile, unheralded thespians manage to unlock world-class talent in others?

One cause may be this: superstars often don’t have to pay meticulous atten- tion to the what’s-next and how-to of each step. The very thing that makes them

brilliant, an intuitive and lightning-quick understanding of how to handle a given problem on the stage or the court or the ﬁeld, keeps the most talented from

recognizing how the rest of us, for whom the intuition does not come quick as silver, learn. The rest of us, who cannot see it once and then do it ourselves

beginning to end, are more likely to take complex tasks and break them down into manageable steps. We move piecemeal toward mastery and need to remind

ourselves over and over what step comes next. Teach Like a Champion

We move piecemeal toward mastery and need to remind

ourselves over and over what step comes next.

One of my soccer coaches had been an all-world superstar as a player. As

coach, he’d stand on the sidelines and shout, “Defense, you guys! Defense!!”

We were pretty aware that we were on defense, though, and also pretty aware

we weren’t playing it especially well. He coached by offering pointers “Don’t

tackle there, Doug!” When I started to play for another coach I realized how a coach might also be a teacher. The other coach broke defense down into a series

of steps: First, position yourself increasingly closer to your man as he gets closer to the player with the ball. Second, deny the ball if and only if you are certain

you can intercept. Third, prevent your man from turning if he is facing away from the goal. Fourth, steer your man toward the sidelines if he has the ball and

has turned. Fifth, tackle if you must. Sixth, otherwise keep position between him and the goal.

He focused his coaching (before the game rather than during!) on reminding us what step came next. If my man got the ball, he would gently remind me,

“Don’t let him turn.” If I let him turn (I usually did), he would say, “Take him wide.” If, as was often the case, I found myself unsuccessful, he would say, “If

you must . . . ,” a reminder that keeping my position between the player and the goal was more important than winning the ball. For years after I stopped playing

for him I’d recall his steps (“If you must”) while I played. Once I asked the second coach how he thought to teach the way he did. His reply was revealing:

“That was the only way I could learn it.” If you are teaching in your area of skill and passion, you likely have more

intuition (natural or learned) than your students do, and you can **help** them suc- ceed by subdividing complex skills into component tasks and building knowledge

up systematically. Champion teachers Name the Steps by habit (knowing how to do this is perhaps their superstar intuition). They trafﬁc in recipes: the ﬁve steps

to combining sentences with the same subject, the four steps to regrouping, the six parts of a great literary response. Their students learn the steps, refer to the

map they provide as they are developing competence, and then leave the steps behind when they are familiar enough with the recipe to forget they are following

it. Perhaps they even add their own variations and ﬂourishes. For most, this is the path to becoming a virtuoso.

So keep in the back of your head the distinction between champion perform- ers and champion teachers. Champion teachers **help** their students learn complex

Structuring and Delivering Your Lessons 79 skills by breaking them down into manageable steps and, often, giving each step

a name so that it can be easily recalled. This allows the process to take on a consistent, often story-like progression. There are not just ﬁve steps to combin-

ing sentences with the same subject, but the steps are named, given a catchy mnemonic to **help** students recall them in order, and posted in the classroom so

they can be used and referred to over and over again. Here are four key components, or subtechniques, that are often part of Name

the Steps classrooms: 1. Identify the steps. ****Teaching**** the process makes complex skills transparent

to students. For example, Kelli Ragin doesn’t just teach students to round whole numbers to a given place value; she teaches them the ﬁve steps for rounding

whole numbers to a given place value: 1.

Underline the digit in the place you are rounding to. 2.

Circle the digit to the right of the underlined digit. 3.

If the circled digit is four or less, the underlined digit stays the same; if the circled digit is ﬁve or more, the underlined digit gets one more.

4. All of the digits to the left of the underlined digit stay the same.

5. All of the digits to the right of the underlined digit become zeroes.

Ragin calls the portion of the **lesson** where she introduces these steps her “Rules and Tools.” When she names the steps, she’s careful about keeping to a

limited number. The reason is that people have a hard time remembering more than seven items in sequence, so having more than seven steps is a recipe for

confusion. If you have too many steps to remember them clearly and easily, it’s the same as having none at all. Ragin is also intentional about maintaining

economy of language in her steps. As she teaches rounding, she adds wrinkles and complexity, but the part she wants her students to remember is intentionally

focused and crisp. A teacher who examines a process like the one for rounding carefully and

puts them into sequential steps gives her students scaffolding. This scaffolding is powerful, and with it the students can attack any similar problem. It essentially

gives them a map to refer to if they get stuck, especially if they have written the steps down in their notes, as Ragin requires. This means they’ll also have the

support they need to complete problems for homework no matter where they are and when they do the work. Finally, having clear and concrete steps lets Ragin

post them on the walls of her classroom as a reminder. This makes the walls functional, not just decorative and motivating.

Teach Like a Champion Some schools don’t stop at identifying steps for speciﬁc skills; they ﬁgure

out the steps implicit in broader practices and methods, such as what to do when you are stumped and can’t solve a problem or what to do when you are reading

and don’t understand a sentence. 2. Make them “sticky.” Once you’ve identiﬁed steps, name them (if pos-

sible). This is the ﬁrst step to make them memorable and therefore stick in your students’ minds. It’s also a trick to go a step further in stickiness by creating a

story or a mnemonic device around the names for you steps. A teacher who was trying to **help** her students master the skill of inferring

the meaning of an unfamiliar word or phrase from context clues created these steps for her students:

1. Figure out the general context of the word. What does it seem to have to

do with? Words about cooking? About sports? About money? About happy things? About sad things?

2. Look for an appositive: a restatement of the word’s meaning somewhere in

the sentence. 3.

Spot relationship words. And, but, and because tell how a word relates to other words: “I tried to stand but tumbled off the cart.” “But” tells you

tumbling is the opposite of standing. In order to make this more memorable to her class so that it was as simple

and easy for them to recall as possible, this teacher added a mnemonic. She simpliﬁed each step into one word and strung the ﬁrst words together to make

an acronym, explaining that each letter in CAR stands for one of the steps in solving a context clue question:

Context Apposition

Relational words Then to make the idea of the CAR even stickier, she made up a catchphrase:

“To gather the clues, you’ve gotta drive the CAR!” She trained her students in a Call and ****Response**** (technique 23 in Chapter Four) to remind them what to

do. When she called out the ﬁrst half of the sentence, they’d respond with the second half:

****Teacher****: Looks like we need some clues here. And to gather the clues, class?!

Students: You gotta drive the CAR!!

Structuring and Delivering Your Lessons 81 To add to the fun and make the steps more memorable, she used lots of

catchy metaphors in class. When an unfamiliar word that she wanted students to infer the meaning of appeared in the text, she might say, “Who wants to drive?!”

or “I think I hear an engine running!” In her rounding **lesson**, Ragin used an interesting variation on this. She

recognized that the most important steps were remembering what to do if the circled digit is four or fewer or ﬁve or more. So she wrote a song to make that

step especially sticky. It’s sung to the tune of Rawhide: Roundin’, roundin’, roundin’, keep those numbers roundin’. Keep those numbers

roundin’—Roundin’. Five or more? Kick it up! Four or less? Stays the same! All the rest go to zero,

roundin’ Roundin’, roundin’, roundin’.

For that extra touch of stickiness, Ragin occasionally gets out her cowboy hat when her ﬁfth graders sing the song. After that, all she needs to do it point

to it, and her kids remember what to do. 3. Build the steps. In designing lessons, it’s essential to name steps and

make them memorable. Equally as important is the understanding that designing the steps can be a key part of teaching too. A memorable **lesson** can be to

derive the rules with students from one or several example problems through structured inquiry. For example, in her ﬁrst **lesson** on rounding, before she’s

talked to her students about what to do when a series of digits carry over in sequence, as they would in 9,998 rounded to the nearest ten, Ragin gives her

students a challenge problem that becomes the basis of her next **lesson** where she derives the steps for handling such problems. She didn’t do this impromptu.

The “answer” steps her students arrived at as the key to solving such problems was carefully planned in advance.

4. Use two stairways. Once students know the steps, classrooms can have two parallel conversations going at once: how to get an answer to the current

problem and how to answer any problem like this. In other words, students can narrate the process or the problem, and the teacher switches back and forth, as

in this sequence from a **lesson** on multiplying fractions: ****Teacher****:

What’s the next step, Paul? [process] Paul:

Multiply the numerators. Teach Like a Champion

****Teacher****: Okay, what are the numerators? [problem]

Paul: The numerators are 4 and 1.

****Teacher****: So the numerator in our solution is going to be? [problem]

Paul: It’s going to be 4.

****Teacher****: Okay, good. So, Sasha, what do we need to do next? [process]

Sasha: We need to multiply the denominators.

****Teacher****: And the denominator is? [problem]

Sasha: The denominator should be 2.

****Teacher****: So I’m done, right Conrad? [process]

Conrad: No, you have to reduce.

****Teacher****: Perfect. So what’s our ﬁnal answer?” [problem]

Conrad: The answer is 2.

You can often take advantage of this dynamic by adjusting roles, sometimes asking students to focus on explaining the process while she does the math, some-

times asking them to do the math while reminding them of the process, and sometimes doing both. Sometimes you can ask one student to concentrate on

one and one student to concentrate on the other. Sometimes you can solve a problem and ask students to explain what you’re doing and why. Sometimes

you’ll make mistakes and ask them where you went wrong or what a better way to solve would have been. In short, teaching the steps makes the process legible

and easily followed in a consistent way.

# Technique 14

# Board = paper

Students often have to learn how to be students as much as they need to learn

**content** and skills, and the processes and practices of being a student also must be assimilated by modeling. This includes one of the most complex and critical

aspects of being a student: learning to take notes and retain a record of one’s knowledge. As a matter of habit, expecting students to make an exact replica

in their notes of what you write on the board is the right starting point (hence Structuring and Delivering Your Lessons 83

the name of this technique: Board = Paper). As students grow they can begin learning to make intentional decisions about how to take notes and what to

include, but that process should wait until they’re totally reliable and automatic about getting what matters down right, and the best way to accomplish this goal

is to start by making your overhead a mirror image of the graphic organizer you give to students to take notes on. As you ﬁll in a blank, they ﬁll in a blank. You

ﬁll out the projected worksheet on the board and say, “Make your paper look like mine.”

Figure 3.1 shows the overhead a third-grade science teacher used during her **lesson** on the muscular system. Her students ﬁlled out the exact same information

in hard copy at their desks, allowing her to teach them not only about muscles The Muscular System

but about note taking and organizing information as well. By contrast, Figure 3.2 shows the notes a student took in another classroom where the teacher instructed

students to “take careful notes on a separate sheet of paper.” Gradually students should progress in the amount of the note taking they

exercise discretion over, ﬁlling out longer and longer passages of their graphic organizers on their own and ﬁnally taking notes on a separate sheet of paper as

you write terms and deﬁnitions on the board exactly as you wish students to copy them down. As you introduce the skill of note taking, guide students through the

process, telling them what to title their papers, when to skip a line, how to make subheadings and headings. When they can do this reliably, you can again

gradually begin to divest yourself of responsibility for exact phrasing and let students own even that, but know that it may take years before students are

ready to own full responsibility for such a critical piece of the process.

# Technique 15

# Circulate

Circulate is a technique for moving strategically around your room during

all parts of your **lesson**. (It’s not only relevant to the “I” portion, but as it’s critical to think about from the outset, I’ll address it here.) As a profession, we

Structuring and Delivering Your Lessons 85 frequently talk about “proximity”—getting near students to stress accountabil-

ity and eliminate behavioral problems—but teachers often expect proximity to magically work of its own accord. They know to move toward trouble but aren’t

always as conﬁdent in knowing how to maximize its beneﬁts and what to do when they get there if proximity by itself proves insufﬁcient. And of course

there’s a whole lot more to know about how you move around your classroom beyond just proximity:

• Break the plane. The “plane” of your classroom is the imaginary line that runs the length of the room, parallel to and about ﬁve feet in front of the board,

usually about where the ﬁrst student desks start. Many teachers are hesitant or slow to “break the plane” and move past this imaginary barrier and out among

the desks and rows. It’s important, however, to try to break the plane within the ﬁrst ﬁve minutes

of every class. You want to make it clear to students that you own the room—that it is normal for you to go anywhere you want in the classroom at any time.

Furthermore, you want to break the plane before a behavioral correction requires you to. This will show that you move where you want as a product of your

decisions about teaching rather than as a product of student behavior. If you don’t do these things, you risk allowing the territory beyond the plane to become

the property of your students. Just as important, when you move out into the classroom to establish prox-

imity only when you need to (to address a behavioral situation), this action will be highly visible to all and in essence you will be telling students that things

aren’t going well and they’ve got you off your game. It also calls heightened **attention** to what you do when you break the plane. This will make the subtlety

necessary to corrections that don’t interrupt **instruction** (for example, via proxim- ity) almost impossible. If instead you’re constantly out and about, you’ll be able

to correct inconspicuously as you teach or go about what appears to be a normal routine.

Breaking the plane shows that you move where you want as

a product of your decisions about teaching rather than as

a product of student behavior. .• Full access required. Not only

must you be able to break the plane, but you must have full access to the entire

room. You must be able to simply and naturally stand next to any student in

your room at any time and be able to get anywhere in your room easily and sim-

ply without interrupting your teaching. Teach Like a Champion

This is the only way to own the room. If you can’t, students will quickly estab- lish a “no-ﬂy zone” that they know to be safely insulated from your inﬂuence.

If getting anywhere would require the shufﬂing and dragging aside of backpacks or the moving of multiple chairs, then ownership has already been ceded. If you

have to say “excuse me” to get around chairs and backpacks and desks to reach the back corner, then you are asking permission of the students to stand in that

space. This means they own it, not you. This is a price no teacher can pay. Keep your passageways wide and clear; ﬁnd a better place for backpacks than

on the back of chairs; seat your students in pairs so you can stand directly next to anyone at any time.

. • Engage when you circulate. It’s not enough to just stand there; you’ve

got to work a room. If you’re teaching actively (in the “I” or “We” portion of your **lesson**), make frequent verbal and nonverbal interventions (hands subtly on

Steven’s shoulders to remind him to sit up; “check your spelling” to Pamela as you gaze at her notes) as you circulate. There’s nothing more awkward than

a teacher walking toward a student in hopes of extinguishing a behavior only to get there and realize that proximity alone hasn’t worked. Normalizing quiet,

private interactions as you circulate gives you space to respond when you get there, hopefully with some of the tools described in 100 Percent, What to Do,

and Strong Voice (techniques 36 to 38 in Chapter Six). It’s equally important to offer positive reinforcement as you circulate, again either verbally or nonverbally

(thumbs up to Michael; “I like it” to Jasmine as you glance at her notes) and constructively. Finally, reading, assessing, and responding to student work as it

is happening is indispensable to checking for understanding and sets a tone of accountability. Both are critical to your ability to provide academic support and

rigor (“Try that one again, Charles”; “Just right, Jamel”; “You haven’t shown me the third step”).

• Move systematically. Look for opportunities to circulate systematically— that is, universally and impersonally—but unpredictably. This not only exerts

accountability pressure on all students but allows you to exert pressure on the students who pose the greatest challenges for you without revealing to them

that they pose a challenge. If you announce to your class, “I need everyone’s eyes on me,” and march directly toward Alphonse, your toughest kid, you are

telling Alphonse that you are worried that he will not comply and you may not be able to control him. Alphonse may comply with that request, but inside he

may be smiling, knowing that he has you rattled. Preemptively moving down each row, asking each student for his or her eyes in turn, and pausing brieﬂy for

them to meet your eyes, will ensure that you address Alphonse but you won’t Structuring and Delivering Your Lessons 87

make your anxiety about him visible. Of course, there will also be times when he is off task and you must move right toward him, but when you are making a

proactive request, do your best to treat Alphonse like just another member of the class by moving systematically.

Be aware, though, that systematic is not the same as predictable. If you always follow a predictable order of interactions as you circulate, students will

know when you’ll be likely to get to them and react accordingly. Avoid using the same pattern every time (left to right; clockwise around the room). Vary your

pattern and skip interacting with some students (and invest heavily in time spent with others) unpredictably as you circulate.

• Position for power. As you circulate, your goal should be to remain facing as much of the class as possible. Then you can see what’s going on

around you at a glance and with minimal transaction cost. You can lift your eyes quickly from a student’s paper and then return to reading in a fraction of a

second. Turning your back, by contrast, invites opportunistic behavior. Think of yourself as the sun: it turns on two axes at the same time, both revolving (moving

around the sun) and rotating (changing the way it faces). This may require you to consider what side of students you stand on as you circulate and to lift a

student’s paper off his desk and subtly reorient yourself to face more of the class as you read. Second, leverage student blind spots. The most powerful position

to be in with another person is one where you can see him, he knows you can see him, and he can’t see you. Standing just over a student’s shoulder as you

peruse his work or standing at the back of the classroom as a class discusses a topic builds subtle but pervasive control of the classroom **environment** in order

to focus it on learning.

# See it in action: clip 6

# Circulate

In clip 6 on the DVD, you can see Domari Dickinson of Rochester Prep mod-

eling Circulate. Notice how Dickinson interacts with her seventh graders both actively (asking them questions and offering reminders) and passively

(taking work and reading it silently; using proximity). Dickinson is also the master of the nonverbal. As she reads a student’s

paper, she typically stands behind the student, eliminating the distraction Teach Like a Champion

her own actions could provide but also keeping him in suspense by standing just over his shoulder where he can’t see her but knows she’s there. As she

moves around the classroom, she turns to face the majority of the class while she reads so she can check on them with the simplest possible upward

glance.

# Technique 16

# Break it down

Break It Down is a critically important teaching tool, but it can be challenging to

use because it is primarily a reactive strategy. You use it in response to a student error at the moment the incorrect answer happens. Most teachers recognize that

when a student error occurs, simply repeating the original question is unlikely to be especially helpful unless you have reason to believe the student failed to hear

you the ﬁrst time. But what to do instead? As soon as they recognize an error or a guess, champion teachers conceptualize the original material as a series

of smaller, simpler pieces. They then go back and ask a question or present information that bridges the part of the material that they think was most likely

to have caused the error, thus building the student’s knowledge back up from a point of partial understanding.

Consider a simple example. A student in Darryl Williams’s classroom, read- ing aloud, was unable to decode the word nature. He hesitatingly sounded

“nah . . . nah” before falling silent. Williams responded by writing the word on the board and saying, “This is the word you’re trying to read.” He paused brieﬂy

and drew a short horizontal line (the sign of a long vowel) above the “a.” He paused again to see if the student recognized the meaning. He didn’t, and Darryl

proceeded to break it down one step further, saying, “long a,” as he pointed to the horizontal line. This intervention was effective. With new information on the

problem spot, the vowel sound, the student was able to combine the new knowl- edge Williams provided with the knowledge he had of the other letter sounds.

He now read the word correctly. Williams had successfully isolated the problem part within the larger error

and caused the student to use his previous knowledge to arrive at a successful solution without Williams providing it. Williams might have just said, “That word

is nature.” This would have been faster for sure, but it would have left the student Structuring and Delivering Your Lessons 89

with little or no cognitive work to do and would have emphasized the failure rather than the success (both in terms of the student ultimately getting it right and

also in terms of his using some knowledge he did have to solve the problem). You never know exactly how

big the gap is between the student’s level of knowledge

and the knowledge necessary for mastery.

It’s worthwhile to note at how many different levels even this question could

be broken down because determining the degree to which to break down a prob-

lem or question is a critical decision. You never know exactly how big the gap

is between the student’s level of knowl- edge and the knowledge necessary for

mastery, but in most cases, you want to provide the smallest hint possible and still enable your student to get to the cor-

rect answer successfully. This will cause your student to apply what she knows to the greatest degree possible. It’s worth thinking about some of the subtler ways

that information can be broken down. For example, in the case of the student struggling to read the word nature, merely rewriting the word on the board, a

very minimal hint, might have proven effective. Seeing the word in a new context (on the board where perhaps he’d seen it before) might have jogged his memory.

Providing such a minimal hint gets at the tension in Break It Down, however. While one goal is to break things down to the least degree possible, another is to

do it quickly, thus managing time and pace. Meticulously adding a thin additional slice of knowledge to each previous subtle hint would be the perfect solution to

the goal of causing students to do the greatest amount of cognitive work, but would likely derail **instruction** in a series of tedious exercises and squander time

that could be used more productively. Figure 3.3, on the next page, illustrates that challenge.

As the ﬁgure suggests, Break It Down is a complex and challenging tech- nique. One of the best ways to ensure success with it is to prepare for it as part

of the **lesson** planning process by identifying potential trouble spots and draft- ing both anticipated wrong answers and possible cues. Another solution is to use

consistent types of follow-ups. These patterns are often highly successful and are a good starting point in thinking about how to cue. Although there are probably

a limitless number of ways to break down difﬁcult information and tasks, these six offer a good starting point:

• Provide an example. If you got a blank stare when you asked for the deﬁnition of a prime number, you might say, “7 is one,” or “7 is one, and so

is 11.” If you wanted to break it down further, you could cue: “7 is one but Teach Like a Champion

How Break It Down Works

8 is not.” You could take it a step further by observing, “8’s factors include 2 and 4.” At some point there’s not much left to cue, and a technique like No

Opt Out (technique 1)—“Who can tell David what a prime number is?”—might become more appropriate. You can also provide additional examples if the ques-

tion stumping the student was originally based on categorizing an example of something. For example, a student in Jaimie Brillante’s ﬁfth-grade writing class

struggled to identify the part of speech of the word owner. It’s hard to provide an example of the word owner, so instead Brillante provided another, cueing:

“Well, owner would logically be the same part of speech as other words that end in -er. Dancer, swimmer, singer. What are those?” she asked. “They’re people,”

the student replied. Jaimie prompted, “And people have to be . . . ” as the student chimed in, “Nouns!”

• Provide context. Another student in Jamie Brillante’s class was stumped when asked to name the part of speech of the word ancient. Brillante noted that

it had been a vocabulary word in another teacher’s class. The student remained Structuring and Delivering Your Lessons 91

stumped: “I hope nobody ever calls me ancient,” cued Brillante. Nothing. “Maybe in, like 2080, you could call me ancient, but that would be the only time it

was acceptable.” “Oh yeah, it’s very old,” the student successfully recalled. It’s important to note that Brillante is using this approach with a vocabulary word

she knows the student learned but is having trouble remembering. This strategy would be far less effective if Brillante did not know whether

the student knew anything at all about the word. To return to the deﬁnition of prime number, you might observe that positive integers are either prime or

composite. Or you might refer to a previous conversation: “We discussed prime and composite, and we spent some time on the example of the number 8.” Or:

“You’ll recall from our discussion last week that factors are important in deciding whether a number is prime.”

• Provide a rule. In Christy Huelskamp’s sixth-grade reading class at Williamsburg Collegiate in Brooklyn, a student guessed incorrectly that indis-

criminate was a verb when used in the sentence, “James was an indiscriminate reader; he would pick up any book from the library and read it cover to cover.”

Huelskamp replied with a rule: “A verb is an action or a state of being. Is indiscriminate describing an action?” The student quickly recognized that it was

modifying a noun. “It’s an adjective,” she said. • Provide the missing (or ﬁrst) step. When a student in her ﬁfth-grade

math class was unable to explain what was wrong with writing the number 15/6, Kelli Ragin cued: “Well, what do we always do when the numerator is larger

than the denominator?” Instantly the student caught on. “Oh, we need to make a mixed number so I divide 6 into 15.”

• Rollback. Sometimes it’s sufﬁcient to repeat a student’s answer back to her. Many of us instantly recognize our errors when they’re played back for us,

as if on tape. If a student in Ragin’s class had proposed reducing an improper fraction to a mixed number by multiplying the numerator and denominator,

Kelli might merely repeat that back to her: “You said that I would multiply six times ﬁfteen to reduce . . . ” The degree of emphasis she places on the word

multiply would be key in determining how much of the gap between answer and mastery Ragin was breaking down. (Emphasis on multiply makes the hint

much bigger.) Regardless, hearing your own error is another’s words is often revealing.

• Eliminate false choices. When Brillante’s student struggled to recognize that owner was a noun, she could have eliminated some false choices as follows:

“Well, let’s go through some of the options. If it were a verb, it would be an Teach Like a Champion

action. Is owner an action? Can you or I owner? Well, what about an adjective? Is it telling me what **kind** or how many of some noun?”

# Technique 17

# Ratio

One of our most important goals as teachers is to cause students to do as much

of the cognitive work—the writing, the thinking, the analyzing, the talking—as possible. The proportion of the cognitive work students do in your classroom

is known as your Ratio. (To my knowledge, the term was coined by David Levin, cofounder of the nationally known and high-achieving Knowledge Is

Power (KIPP for short) schools and, in many people’s eyes, one of the country’s most insightful and effective teachers.) As you embrace Ratio, you’ll ﬁnd your-

self rarely completing a problem at the board without input of your students: to add each column (“6 plus 8 is what, Sarah?”); to identify the next step (“What

do I do with my 1, James?”); to reinforce key terms (“What’s it called when I bring it to the top of the tens column, Jamar?”); and ﬁnally to check the work.

When your students answer incorrectly, you’ll ﬁnd yourself asking a student to correct and explain the mistake (“Valerie says 6 divided by 2 is 5. What did

she do wrong, Ray?”). Your goal is to give them the most practice possible, to apply what they know as much as they can, to do all the work in solving sample

problems as opposed to watching you solve sample problems. My own understanding of this complex technique was developed signiﬁcantly

by a conversation with Jesse Rector, principal of North Star Academy’s Clinton Hill Campus, who felt that one of my favorite Ratio clips was disappointing.

Rector observed that while students in the clip were participating actively, almost intensely, he did not think they were engaged in the deepest levels of thinking. His

comments caused me to distinguish between what I’ll call the “****Thinking**** Ratio” and the “****Participation**** Ratio.” The ****Participation**** Ratio describes how much of the

participating—the answering, the talking, the writing—students do. Imagine a **lesson** in which students are reviewing a skill they are near to

mastering or perhaps trying new and more challenging problems involving a process they’re familiar with, say, ﬁguring the volume of a rectangular prism.

Your goal is to give them the most practice possible, to apply what they know as much as they can, to do all the work in solving sample problems as opposed to

watching you solve sample problems. You might ask questions like, “Who can tell me the ﬁrst step?” “And what’s my value for width?” “Great! And what do

Structuring and Delivering Your Lessons 93 I do next?” “What do I need to be careful of?” “If my length increased by 1

and my width decreased by 1, would my volume stay the same?” These types of questions, which force students to apply and consolidate their knowledge, are

important. But so are questions that ask students to push their depth of thinking and analyze new **content**. This would be more applicable when working through

a problem on volume for the ﬁrst time or perhaps when wrestling with a question where the right answer is a matter of opinion. In this case, the questions might

sound more like, “Why might I need to multiply?” “How is volume different from area?” “When might I measure volume?” “What would happen to my volume if

my width increased?” The ****Thinking**** Ratio gets more at the depth of the increased amounts of participating students do.

# Key idea

# Ratio

A successful **lesson** is rarely marked by a teacher’s getting

a good intellectual workout at the front of the room. Push more and more of the cognitive work out to students as soon

as they are ready, with the understanding that the cognitive work must be on-task, focused, and productive.

Champion teachers use dozens of methods in upping the ratio; it would be impossible to categorize them all, but what follows are ten especially effective

methods for productively upping your ratio. They are organized around the rough amount of **lesson** structure they imply. That is, the ﬁrst methods are most effec-

tive during what you might call direct **instruction**: teacher-led dissemination of information. The latter methods are more likely to apply during discussions with

more student participation: 1. Unbundle. Break questions into smaller parts to share the work out to

more students and force them to react to one another. Instead of, “Who can tell me the three dimensions of a cylinder?” try a sequence like this:

“How many dimensions to a cylinder, James?” Teach Like a Champion

“Good. What’s one dimension, Shayna?” “And what’s another, Diamond?”

“That leaves what, Terrance?” 2. Half-statement. Rather than speaking in complete ideas, express half of

an idea and ask a student to ﬁnish it: “So the next step is to combine sentences with a . . . tell me please, John.”

3. What’s next? The fastest way to double the number of questions students get to answer is to ask about process as often as product, that is, addressing both

how to solve a step (or what the answer to a step in a problem is) and what step comes next. Incidentally, the hardest what’s next question is the one for the ﬁrst

step in any solution: “Okay, what do I do ﬁrst?” 4. Feign ignorance. Turn the tables, and pretend you don’t know. Make the

student play teacher and narrate what you might otherwise explain: “So, now can I just add my numerators?”

“A theme is just a summary of what happens in the story, right?” 5. Repeated examples. Teachers often ask for examples: of a term they’re

deﬁning, a concept in action, a character’s trait. They less often ask students for another example, especially one that’s different from the ﬁrst. This tech-

nique can be especially rigorous when you set the terms for how the second example should be different. Beth Verilli at North Star Academy asked her

students to apply the word exploited to their reading of Macbeth. “Who gets exploited in Macbeth?” she asked, and following up by asking for yet another

example with a different character. A teacher in this situation might also steer the second example: “Who gets exploited more subtly? Repeatedly? With or without

knowing it?” 6. Rephrase or add on. Second drafts are better than ﬁrst drafts because

some of the most rigorous thinking goes into making ideas more precise, spe- ciﬁc, and rich. Replicate this in the classroom by asking a student to rephrase

and improve an answer she just gave or by asking another student to revise or improve a peer’s answer. In a **lesson** on Animal Farm, Rochester Prep prin-

cipal (and sometime reading teacher) Stacey Shells asked a student why the rations due to all of the animals on Orwell’s mythical farm were reduced except

those of the pigs and the dogs. The student answered, “The pigs’ and the dogs’ rations were not reduced because they were the higher . . . standard of life. They

were the ones being treated better.” Her answer was solid but weak in syntax and speciﬁcity of language. “You are correct,” Shells responded, “but rephrase

that.” When the student struggled, Shells asked her peers, “Who can give her Structuring and Delivering Your Lessons 95

a word to use that will **help** her make her answer better?” and a peer sug- gested trying to use the word class. The student upgraded: “The pigs and the

dogs were of a higher class than all the other animals so their rations weren’t reduced.”

7. Whys and hows. Asking why or how instantly pushes more, and more rigorous, work onto students by forcing them to explain the thinking that solved

(or failed to solve) the problem. 8. Supporting evidence. There’s far more cognitive work to be done in

supporting an opinion than in holding one, in testing its logic than in arguing for it. This process of stating an argument and supporting it involves extensive

cognitive wrestling that can push your ratio higher. Ask your students constantly to explain how the evidence supports them. Or give them a position or a variety

of opinions and ask them to assemble evidence in support. 9. Batch process. As your students progress in the grades and into broader

discussions, it’s powerful for the teacher to strategically step out of the way at times and not comment on and validate every student comment and instead allow

a short series of student comments to be made directly following, and ideally in response to, one another. I’ve seen this described as playing volleyball rather

than Ping-Pong, but I prefer the term batch processing because it underscores that it’s still your job to process and respond to student answers. They don’t go

unmediated by you. They just get discussed in smaller groups rather than singly. If you prefer the volleyball analogy, ﬁne, but I’d offer three pieces of advice

based on observing champion teachers: •

It’s volleyball, not soccer. In volleyball, teammates pass the ball a limited number of times before returning the ball over the net. In the classroom,

your students should, similarly, make ﬁnite group comments in a row as you continue to steer, respond, and process. They get the ball, then, after two or

three hits, you get the ball. In soccer, by contrast, the goal of the players is to maintain possession constantly. That often means sacriﬁcing movement

toward the goal in order to keep the ball from the opposition for as long as possible. In the classroom, your students are not maintaining possession for

as long as they want. Structure it so the ball is expected to pass back over to you at frequent and regular intervals. You may pass it back again, but

you will do so having controlled the direction, pace, and focus of play to maximize productivity. If left unmanaged, students will often revert to soccer

and take the ball in whatever direction best allows them to keep it—and that almost always means failure to get to the goal.

• Batch processing can be nonproductive until students are mature and ready

for it. If they are not intellectually prepared through years of study, they may Teach Like a Champion

go batting balls off in every direction. Be cautious with batch processing. Use it strategically, not as a default. ****Observation**** of champions suggests caution

in using batch processing aggressively before high school. •

Teach habits of discussion ﬁrst. Volleyball games work because everyone knows how to pass the ball and when it needs to go back over the net.

They know this because they’ve been coached. The most effective teachers and schools I’ve seen do batch processing well intentionally teach “habits of

discussion,” as my colleagues at North Star Academy in Newark call them: basic procedures for how to interact. At North Star, teachers provide students

with phrase starters to use in interacting: •

I agree with x because . . . •

I want to say more about what you said . . . •

That’s true because . . . •

I understand what you’re saying, but I have a different opinion [point or view] . . .

• What evidence can you give to support your opinion?

10. Discussion objectives. Open-ended questioning and broad discussions can seem like the Ratio Rosetta stone. They almost by their nature appear to increase

Ratio. But they can just as easily result in nonproductive Ratio —in students thinking or talking a lot but not thinking rigorously (people often confuse the

amount of student participation for Ratio) or in students thinking about periph- eral or suboptimal topics. The goal is to try to focus discussions on the most

productive and rigorous points. Teachers who do this have a clear objective in mind for any open-ended discussion and use hints to steer their students back on

task and, especially, head off distractions and unproductive topics. Often they use the former to achieve the latter, that is, they share the objective for the discussion

with students so they can remind them of their purpose when they stray. Emily Crouch, who teaches at Leadership Preparatory Charter ****School**** in Brooklyn, did

this in a recent **lesson**. She read a story about a girl and advised her students that their goal in discussing the story was to determine which of several subtly

different character traits provided the best description of her. This discussion was not only rigorous and evidence based but efﬁcient: when a student suggested a

totally different trait he thought was evidenced, she reminded him that their goal was to decide from among the similar traits they’d identiﬁed at the outset, thus

keeping the discussion focused and productive. Structuring and Delivering Your Lessons 97

Before you set out to put these ideas into action in your classroom, I have two caveats. The ﬁrst is that increased doses of cognitive work should come as

soon as students are ready but not before. Releasing students to solve a problem that requires a skill they hadn’t learned or mastered yet, in the hopes that they

might infer that skill by trying, would result in students doing a lot of think- ing but not a lot of productive thinking. I once observed a teacher who told

her third graders to look through the book they were about to read to make inferences about what it was about. Alas, she had never taught them how to

do that, so many ﬂipped idly and at random through the pages, with most fail- ing to take advantage of subtitles, chapter headings, and captions that might

have informed them better. Any useful cognitive work they did was likely to be accidental.

The second caveat is that increased doses of cognitive work should be given with constant and vigilant discipline in making that work focused and productive.

You want students to do larger and larger shares of the right work. Theoret- ically, your ratio would be perfect if you simply let students run the whole

discussion and just got out of the way. You might say, “Class, your task for today is to determine the most important historical ﬁgure in nineteenth-century

America. I expect you to discuss this question and report back to me in one hour.” Or even better, “Class, here is a set of data about how a series of bodies

in space react to one another. I’d like you to do your best to infer principles of gravitation from it. I will be here if you need me.” Your ratio would be

perfect: 100 percent! But your results would not. Your students would almost assuredly not get to the right answer at all. And if they did, they would cer-

tainly not get there in the most efﬁcient way. They would waste a massive amount of time and preclude themselves from studying any number of other

topics.

# Technique 18

# Check for understanding

Good drivers check their mirrors every ﬁve seconds. They constantly need to

know what’s happening around them because waiting for an accident to tell them they’re doing something wrong is a costly strategy. As a teacher, you should think

the same way, seeking constant opportunities to assess what your kids can do while you’re teaching and using that knowledge to inform what you do and how

Teach Like a Champion The technique could more

accurately be described as Check for ****Understanding**** and

Doing Something About It Right Away. That’s not

especially pithy, but it better captures the two key aspects

of Check for ****Understanding****: gathering and responding to

data. you do it. Waiting until there’s an

accidental failure to comprehend means paying an unsustainably high price for

knowledge. I’ve

chosen to

use a

term in

common use to describe this technique, Check for ****Understanding****, but

it’s a risky one to use since it leaves the

equation half

done. The

technique could

more accurately be

described as Check for ****Understanding**** and Do

Something About It Right Away. That’s not

especially pithy,

but it

better captures the two key aspects of Check

for ****Understanding****:

gathering and

responding to data.

# Gathering data

Questioning is data gathering. Check for ****Understanding**** requires you to think

of the answers to your questions as data. Consider two teachers who ask their students to name a chief cause of the Civil War. In each case, three students

answer incorrectly or incompletely before a fourth student gives an accurate answer. One teacher sees the answers as a story, a sequential narrative of the

class’s progress toward understanding that ends in success. She listens as her students wrestle with the question, and when she gets a correct answer, thinks,

Check for ****Understanding**** requires you to think of the

answers to your questions as data.

“Oh, good they ﬁnally got it.” The other teacher sees not so much a story writ-

ten in a sequence of answers, but a set of four independent variables, four sepa-

rate data points. The narrative sequence is irrelevant, and the numbers cause her

concern. She thinks, “Only one out of four kids understands the causes of the Civil War. I need to circle back.” The

second teacher treats answers as data; she is effectively checking for understand- ing. In this case the technique involves using a simple but powerful analytical

framework to assess answers: sampling. Sampling means asking iterations of a single question or a set of similar questions to a smaller group of students and

using the answers as representative of a larger group’s answers. The sample is a Structuring and Delivering Your Lessons 99

set of data points, each viewed independently, and explicitly used for analysis. The point is that the questions and answers may (sometimes) be the same as in

any other class; the technique lies in how you think about them. Here are four more speciﬁc ways to make your questioning more data driven:

• Data sets. We tend to think of any single answer as reﬂective of where the

class is at any given time. But a single answer can come from anywhere on a curve of student mastery, from low to high, and you will often have no idea

where. Not only that, but even if you knew a question was reﬂective of the class mean, you’d want to think of how much information is hidden by an

average. What’s the highest level of mastery? The lowest? How spread out are students in their level of mastery? Are most students very similar to the

student at the mean or widely dispersed in their level of knowledge? No single question can resolve these critical questions. Instead you should reﬂect on

your questions in groups and think of them, as the second teacher above did, as data sets. If you ask ﬁve students similar questions or different questions on a

similar topic, assess them as a group. What’s the hit rate (percentage correct)? This gives you far better information that does thinking of your questions as a

progression of singular data points. By thinking of your questions as data sets, you come to realize that wrong, wrong, wrong, right is a bad sequence, not

a good one. It also tells you that wrong, right is not enough data. You should keep asking so you know whether you’re dealing with wrong, right, right, right

or wrong, right, wrong, wrong. •

Statistical sampling. As you ask questions in sets, think about taking a sta- tistical sample of the room. If you’re asking your class ﬁve questions to test

whether they understand how to ﬁnd the least common denominator, ask a sample of students from across the spectrum of likely skill: two typically

low-performing students, two middle students, and one high performer. Now you’ll have better information about how far into the class the mastery you’ve

tried to build has spread. Obviously to be able to do this you need to choose who answers, not the kids, so cold calling (calling on whom you want with-

out regard to whose hand is raised) is a critical technique to use. (Cold Call is technique 22 in Chapter Four.)

• Reliability. Any right answer always poses the risk of its being a false

positive—a lucky correct guess. Therefore, stop teaching when your students get it right several times in a row, not once. To ensure reliability

(the likelihood of future correct answers on similar questions), respond to Teach Like a Champion

right answers with follow-up why and how questions as often as you can (see Stretch It, technique 3). This gives you the best data on whether a student

would be likely to get a similar problem right the next time around. If he or she can’t clearly explain it, the risk of a lucky guess is high.

• Validity. Make sure that the question you get a positive result to is an effective

measure of what students have to master to be successful. You have to mea- sure what you say you’re measuring. Therefore, you should carefully align the

questions you ask to check for understanding on the rigor and style of ques- tions your students will ultimately be accountable for. You should make them

sound like, and be at least as hard as, what students will see on the ﬁnal exam, the state assessment, or whatever else your bottom-line measure is.

Especially data-driven teachers often insert a short verbal quiz into the fabric of their **lesson** to increase the amount and usefulness of the data they collect.

James Verilli, principal at North Star Academy in Newark, New Jersey, calls this “dip-sticking.” When he teaches, he samples a wide range of students on a set

of similar questions about a common topic to gauge the level of mastery of the whole class.

Types of Questions Although you can use Check for ****Understanding**** without changing the format of

the questions you ask, thinking about answers as data will probably change your questions. You’re likely to ask far fewer yes-or-no questions since with only two

possible answers, they give a far higher possible rate of false positives. You’re likely to have to learn to be more cognizant of “tipping”—giving the answers

away in your question, as in this sequence: ****Teacher****:

Who can tell me what the phrase “off the deep end” means? ****Student****:

It means someone is upset? ****Teacher****:

Well are they a little bit upset or like really, really upset? ****Student****:

Really, really upset. ****Teacher****:

Good. In this case it’s hard to imagine the student who thinks the answer is

“a little bit upset.” Finally, you’ll probably come to rely a lot less on self- report, a method teachers use frequently—“Thumbs up if you get this, thumbs

Structuring and Delivering Your Lessons 101 down if you don’t.” Aﬁcionados of data know self-report to be chronically

unreliable. ****Observation****

****Observation**** is the second way to determine whether students understand a con- cept, and it addresses a key validity challenge. When you test for mastery using

questioning, you don’t take into account the fact that students can often answer correctly verbally but not in writing. ****Observation**** allows you to see written

answers before you sign off. Furthermore, observation, which involves circu- lating when students are doing independent seat work to observe mastery levels,

requires a larger total investment of time but allows you to see more data points more rapidly during that time. Like questioning, this skill does not so much

involve changing activities as it does thinking of the information in front of you through the data lens. Instead of circulating to see how close to ﬁnished students

are or whether they are working, you would speciﬁcally look for the number and type of errors they are making, possibly even tracking them on a short response

sheet so you can organize and refer back to the data later. One way to increase your capacity to gather useful data through observation

is to standardize the format of what you’re looking at. If you’re looking for information in the same place on each student’s paper, for example, you’ll ﬁnd

it much more quickly and will be able to retain your concentration on comparing answers across students, not ﬁnding them for single students. Giving out packets

is an effective way to do this. If you plan the work you want students to do during your **lesson** in advance, writing out of the problems or questions in order

in a packet that each student picks up at the beginning of class, you know that when you want to see how many students can ﬁnd the least common denominator

of 28 and 77, it will always be at the top of the third page of every student’s packet. You’ve minimized the number of unimportant things you have to process

so you can concentrate on what’s important. You can take this a step further by providing clear spaces for work to be

done or answers to be written. Incidentally, this method works in all subject areas, albeit slightly differently. If you are reading a novel, for example, you

might ask students to underline the place where the protagonist’s motivation is revealed and write “key indicator of motivation” in the margin. Then it would be

easy for you to check for understanding even while students read. Or if you didn’t want to be as prescriptive, you might ask your students to write a one-sentence

summary of each page in a novel at the top of that page. Then you could choose Teach Like a Champion

a relevant page and quickly ﬁnd and compare all summaries in your classroom to better assess the data.

One way to increase your capacity to gather useful data

through observation is to standardize the format of

what you’re looking at. Another way to increase your capac-

ity to gather observable data is to use “slates.” You can quickly check the

whole class’s comprehension by giving your students tools to write down their

answers and quickly hold them up to you. Some teachers use scrap paper, and

others get mini dry-erase boards for their students. You can even use the work-

sheets or packets your students are completing by simply saying, “Show me,” and then circulating to observe. The trick isn’t so much in the tool you use

to gather but in the way you gather and respond to the information. Be sure to observe all students’ answers. Be sure that students can’t cheat by observing

others’ answers before writing their own. Be sure your questions assess mastery effectively and not superﬁcially. Asking students to use nonverbal signals to show

their answer to a series of questions—“One ﬁnger up if you got A; two up if you got B”—can provide an effective and simpler variation on the theme. Just be

aware of the ability of students to hide their lack of knowledge by piggy-backing.

# Key idea

# Check for understanding

Effective Check for ****Understanding**** equals gathering data

constantly and acting on them immediately. The second part (acting on the data quickly) is both harder to do and at least

as important.

# Responding to data

The second part of Check for ****Understanding**** involves responding to the data

you collect. It’s worth noting that all the recognition in the world won’t **help** if it does not result in action. Generally teachers are better at checking for than

Structuring and Delivering Your Lessons 103 acting on gaps in student mastery, so the imperative is not only to act but to

act quickly: the shorter the delay between recognizing a gap in mastery and taking action to ﬁx it, the more likely the intervention is to be effective. There

are exceptions (sometimes you need to identify a small group of students to receive tutoring outside class), but it’s important to recognize the timeliness of

knowledge that students haven’t mastered a concept. There’s no sense pushing on to harder material when you know students can’t do the simpler work. There’s no

sense reading on in the novel when there’s a persistent misunderstanding about what’s happening at the outset. Stop and ﬁx it; then move on. This also makes

sense because the sooner you ﬁx it, the simpler the misunderstanding is likely to be. When an error is compounded by three days or three hours of subsequent

misunderstandings, it’s likely to be complex and thorny; the root cause will take time to ﬁgure out, and you will need a full **lesson** to reteach it. It’s far better

to act quickly and solve learning problems while they are simple and can be addressed with an additional problem, a short activity, or a reexplanation that

takes three minutes rather than thirty-ﬁve. The shorter the delay between

recognizing a gap in mastery and taking action to ﬁx it, the

more likely the intervention is to be effective.

You can take action in response to data in numerous ways. Teachers

sometimes forget the beneﬁt of reteach- ing material in a slightly different way

from the ﬁrst time. Repeating what you did before might work, but it assumes

there aren’t kids who would respond to something slightly different. This

doesn’t mean that you go back and try a whole new method for teach- ing long division, for example. You really should decide on a best way to

do that. But you can explain it in slightly different words or with different examples.

Here are several other actions to take in response to data telling you that student mastery is incomplete:

• Reteach using a different approach.

• Reteach by identifying and reteaching the problem step: “I think the place

we’re struggling is when we get to remainders, so let’s work on that a little more.”

• Reteach by identifying and explaining difﬁcult terms: “I think the term denom-

inator is giving us some trouble.” Teach Like a Champion

• Reteach at a slower pace: “Let’s read that list of words again. I’m going to go

really slowly, and I want you to make sure you hear me read the sufﬁxes. Then I’m going to ask you to . . . ”

• Reteach using a different order: “Let’s try to put the key events in the story in

reverse order this time.” •

Reteach identifying students of concern: “We’re going to push on to the prob- lems in your packet now, but I want a couple of you to come work with me

at the front. If I say your name, bring your packet up here [or meet me at lunch].”

• Reteach using more repetitions: “It seems that we’re able to identify the genre

most of the time, but let’s try to get a bit more practice. I’m going to read you the ﬁrst two sentences to ten imaginary stories. For each one, write down the

genre you think it is and one reason for your answer.”

# Technique 19

# At bats

Many years ago at a school where I used to teach, I was assigned to coach

baseball, a sport I’d played only casually and felt unqualiﬁed to coach. A friend of a friend was a master baseball coach, however, and I got an hour of his

time over coffee to ﬁgure out how to organize my practices. His biggest piece of advice was both simple and enduring and is key to the At Bats technique:

“Teach them the basics of how to hit, and then get them as many at bats as you can. ****Practice**** after practice, swing after swing after swing: maximize the number

of at bats. Let them do it over and over again until they can swing quick and level in their sleep. That’s the key. Don’t change it. Don’t get too fancy. Give

them at bats.” At bats, it turned out, were the key to hitting. Sometimes the obvious truths are the best ones. And in fact this truth is

reafﬁrmed by the data in just about every ﬁeld and every situation. Want to know what single factor best predicts the quality of a surgeon? It’s not her

reputation, not the place where she went to medical school, not even how smart she is. The best predictor is how many surgeries of a particular type she’s done.

It’s muscle memory. It’s repetition. It’s at bats—for complex surgery, hitting baseballs, solving math problems, writing sentences. Repetition is the key for

Structuring and Delivering Your Lessons 105 a surgeon not just because it means she’ll be smoothest when things go as

expected but because if things go wrong, she’ll have the most brainpower left over to engage in problem solving in the moment. With her clamping and cutting

skills reﬁned to automaticity, she’ll calmly have all her faculties to focus on how to respond to the critical and unexpected event.

Want to know what single factor best predicts the quality

of the surgeon you select? It’s not her reputation, not the

place where she went to medical school, not even how

smart she is. The best predictor is how many

surgeries of the type you’re having that she’s done. It’s

muscle memory. It’s repetition.

Nothing inscribes and reﬁnes a skill so that it can be reliably applied under

any circumstances like at bats, so great lessons should have plenty of them. And

if it’s true that people master a new skill on the tenth or twentieth or one thou-

sandth time they do it, never the ﬁrst time, it’s important to factor that into

your lessons. Once your students get to “You,” once they’re doing independent

work, they need lots and lots of prac- tice: ten or twenty repetitions instead of

two or three. This is especially important to remember because in a busy day, suf-

ﬁcient repetition is the ﬁrst thing to go. We teach all the way to the part where

students can ingrain the skill, and we stop. They try it once, and we say, “Good, you’ve got it!” or worse, “We’re

running out of time. Try it at home, and make sure you’ve got it!” A **lesson** should end with students getting at bat after at bat after at bat. It

should often begin with a few at bats on previous material (“cumulative review”). Here are the key points to remember:

• Go until they can do it on their own. By the end of independent practice, stu-

dents should be able to solve problems to the standard they’ll be accountable for, and entirely on their own.

• Use multiple variations and formats. Students should be able to solve ques-

tions in multiple formats and a signiﬁcant number of plausible variations and variables.

• Grab opportunities for enrichment and differentiation. As some students

demonstrate mastery faster than others, be sure to have bonus problems ready for them to push them to the next level.

Teach Like a Champion

# Technique 20

# Exit ticket

End your **lesson** with a ﬁnal At Bat, a single question or maybe short sequence

of problems to solve at the close of class. When you collect this from students before they leave and cull the data, it’s an Exit Ticket. Not only will this establish

a productive expectation about daily completed work for students, but it will ensure that you always check for understanding in a way that provides you with

strong data and thus critical insights. What percentage of your students got it right? What mistake did those who got it wrong make? Why, in looking at their

errors, did they make that mistake? What about your **lesson** might have led to the confusion? Not only will you know how to reﬁne the next **lesson** but you’ll no

longer be ﬂying blind. You’ll know how effective your **lesson** was, as measured by how well they learned it, not how well you thought you taught it.

Some thoughts on effective Exit Tickets: They’re quick: one to three questions. Honestly, that’s it. It’s not a unit quiz.

You want to get a good idea of how your kids did on the core part of your objective with ten minutes of analysis afterward.

They’re designed to yield data. This means the questions are fairly simple and focus on one key part of the objective. That way if students get them

wrong you’ll know why. (If you ask a multi-step problem you may not know which part they didn’t get!) They also tend to vary formats—one

multiple choice and one open response, say. You need to know that stu- dents can solve both ways.

They make great Do Nows (see technique number 29 in Chapter Five). After you’ve looked at the data, let your students do the same. Start the next

day’s **lesson** by analyzing and re-teaching the Exit Ticket when students struggle.

# Technique 21

# Take a stand

This technique involves pushing students to actively engage in the ideas around

them by making judgments about the answers their peers provide. This can allow you to increase the number of students who participate in and process a

Structuring and Delivering Your Lessons 107 particular part of your **lesson**. For example, you might ask your class to respond

to an answer as Rochester Prep’s Bob Zimmerli does: “two snaps if you agree; two stomps if you don’t.” One student answers, but every student has to decide if

the answer is right, and to do that, they have to solve. Done right, this increases your ratio by a factor of about twenty-ﬁve.

Take a Stand techniques can be whole class (“Stand up if you agree with Alexis”) or directed to an individual (“She said 9 times 9 is 81. That’s not right,

is it, Valeria?”). They can be evaluative (“How many people think Dashawn is right?”) or analytical (“How could she check her work to see if she’s right,

Alaina?”). Finally, they can be verbal or signaled through a gesture: “Show me on your hands how big the remainder is.” “Show me on your hands which answer

choice you think is correct.” (Some teachers have students put their heads down to ensure they can’t see one another’s responses when they Take a Stand or write

on scraps of paper or small dry erase boards.) Take a Stand helps students process more **content**, and it helps you check for

understanding. How indicative of the rest of the class was the original student’s answer? Which wrong answer did those who got it wrong choose? Further-

more, since using Take a Stand techniques means explicitly asking one student to evaluate another’s answer—“Is he right, James?” “How many people got the

same answer as Ty?”—the technique brings student answers to the forefront of class. It makes them appear to be as fundamental to the work of learning

as are teacher-given answers and underscores the value teachers put on student responses.

When you ask your students to Take a Stand, be careful

not to let the exercise become cursory.

When you ask your students to Take a Stand, be careful not to let the exercise

become cursory. There are plenty of classrooms where teachers routinely ask

students to agree or disagree or to do “thumbs up, thumbs down, thumbs side-

ways.” The key to maximum effect is not so much asking whether students agree but following up on their answers

to inform your teaching and make students accountable for mentally engaged judgments rather than empty and obligatory participation. To make the technique

effective, you should, with predictable consistency (not every time, perhaps, but fairly reliably), ask students to defend or explain their positions: “Why is your

thumb down, Keisha?” You can raise your hand easily enough; the key is to make sure that students are truly doing cognitive work when they do so, and to

do that, you have to check up on their answers. It’s also important to remem- ber to have students take a stand both when the original answer was right and

Teach Like a Champion when it was wrong and to avoid letting the method you use tip students off. One

teacher I know always asked students “two snaps if you agree; two stomps if you don’t” when the answer was right and “raise your hand if you got the same

answer” when it was wrong. This quickly took all of the intellectual work out of the exercise.

To make this technique succeed, you also have some cultural work to do in making sure that your students are comfortable exposing and discussing their

own errors: stomping when others are snapping or keeping three ﬁngers up when others have four and then in telling you openly about what they thought and

why. Be sure to praise and acknowledge students as they do this. You might say, “Thank you for stomping, Tarynn. I appreciate that you took the risk of

challenging us. Now let’s ﬁgure out why you didn’t agree,” on the front end, or, after this example, “Let’s have two snaps and two stomps for Tarynn for pushing

us all to think.”

# Reflection and practice

The following activities should **help** you think about and practice the

techniques in this chapter: 1.

Choose one of the following deliberately informal topics and sketch out a **lesson** plan that follows an I/We/You structure. In fact, you

can go one step further by planning a ﬁve-step process: I do; I do, you **help**; you do, I **help**; you do; and do and do and do. You don’t

have to assume you’ll be teaching your actual students. •

Students will be able to shoot an accurate foul shot. •

Students will be able to write the name of their school in cursive.

• Students will be able to make a peanut butter and jelly sand-

wich. •

Students will understand and apply the correct procedure for doing laundry in your household.

• Students will be able to change a tire.

2. Now take your **lesson** and design a three- to ﬁve- minute hook that

engages students and sets up the **lesson**. Structuring and Delivering Your Lessons 109

3. Be sure to name the steps in the ‘‘I’’ portion of your **lesson**. Review

them and ﬁnd four or ﬁve ways to make them stickier. 4.

Identify the two or three places in your **lesson** where students are most likely to make a error or misunderstand the **lesson**. Script

Break It Down questions at varying levels of support for each of these likely error points.

5. Design an Exit Ticket that will allow you to accurately assess student

knowledge at the end of the **lesson**. .

# Chapter four

# Engaging students In your lessons

Great teachers engage students so that they feel like part of the **lesson**. They

make a habit of focused involvement in the classroom. While that may already sound easier said than done with the most resistant students, it’s doubly chal-

lenging since students need to be engaged in not just the class but in the work of class. That is, you could easily engage students in class by substituting frills

for substance. The techniques reviewed in this chapter will consistently draw students into the work of class and keep them focused on learning.

# Technique 22

# Cold call

When calling on students during class, it’s natural to think about managing who

gets to participate and think, “How do I give everyone a chance?” “Whose turn is it?” or “Who will give me the answer I want?” However, a more important

question to ask is, “How can I adapt my decisions about which students I call on to **help** all my students pay better **attention**?” The idea, of course, is that you want

everybody to pay **attention** and develop a system that ensures that all students think it’s possible that they are about to be called on, regardless of whether they

have raised their hand, and therefore think they must therefore prepare to answer. You need a system that ensures that instead of one student answering each of

your questions, all of your students answer all of your questions in their minds, with you merely choosing one student to speak the answer out loud. Cold Call

is that system. Teach Like a Champion

# Key idea

# Cold call

In order to make engaged participation the expectation, call

on students regardless of whether they have raised their hands.

When you cold call, you call on students regardless of whether they have raised their hands. It’s deceptively simple: you ask a question and then call the

name of the student you want to answer it. If students see you frequently and reliably calling on classmates who don’t have their hand raised, they will come

to expect it and prepare for it. Calling on whomever you choose regardless of whether the student’s hand is up also brings several other critical beneﬁts to

your classroom. It’s critical to be able to check

what any student’s level of mastery is at any time.

First, it allows you to check for understanding effectively and systemat-

ically. It’s critical to be able to check what any student’s level of mastery is at

any time, regardless of whether he or she is offering to tell you. In fact it’s most

important when he or she is not offering to tell you. Cold Call allows you to check on exactly the student you want to check in on to assess mastery, and

the technique makes this process seem normal. When students are used to being asked to participate or answer by their teacher, they react to it as if it were a

normal event, and this allows you to get a focused, honest answer and therefore check for understanding reliably. This means that while using Cold Call to assist

you in checking for understanding is critical, you’ll also do best if you use it before you need to check for understanding. Your goal is to normalize it as a

natural and normal part of your class, preferably a positive one. Second, Cold Call increases speed in both the terms of your pacing (the

illusion of speed) and the rate at which you can cover material (real speed). To understand the degree to which this is so, make an audiotape of your **lesson**

sometime. Use a stopwatch to track how much time you spend waiting (and encouraging and cajoling and asking) for volunteers. With Cold Call, you no

Engaging Students in Your Lessons 113 With Cold Call, you no longer

have a delay after you ask, ‘‘Can anyone tell me what

one cause of the World War I was?’’

longer have a delay after you ask, “Can anyone tell me what one cause of the

World War I was?” You no longer have to scan the room and wait for hands. You

no longer have to dangle hints to encour- age participants or tell your students that

you’d like to see more hands. Instead of saying, “I’m seeing the same four hands.

I want to hear from more of you. Doesn’t anyone else know this?” you simply say, “Tell us one cause of World War I, please, [slight pause here] Darren.”

With Cold Call, you’ll move through material much faster, and the tedious, momentum-sapping mood when no one appears to want to speak up will dis-

appear. These two results will increase your pacing: the illusion of speed you create in your classroom, which is a critical factor in how students engage (see

Chapter Three for more on pacing). Third, Cold Call allows you to distribute work more broadly around the room

and signal to students not only that they are likely to be called on to participate, and therefore that they should engage in the work of the classroom, but that

you want to know what they have to say. You care about their opinion. Many students have insight to add to your class but will not offer it unless you push or

ask. They wonder if anyone really cares what they think. Or they think it’s just as easy to keep their thoughts to themselves because Charlie’s hand is always up

anyway. Or they have a risky and potentially valuable thought on the tip of their tongue but aren’t quite sure enough of it to say it aloud yet. Sometimes there

will even be a glance—a moment when this student looks at you as if to say, “Should I?” or maybe even, “Just call on me so you’ve shared responsibility if

this is totally off the mark.” Many people mistakenly

perceive cold calling to be chastening and stressful. Once

you’ve watched clips 7, 8, and 9 on the DVD, you’ll know

that it’s not. Many people mistakenly perceive

cold calling to be chastening and stress- ful. Once you’ve watched clips 7, 8, and

9 on the DVD, you’ll know that it’s not. When it’s done right, it’s an extremely

powerful and positive way to reach out to kids who want to speak but are reluc-

tant to be hand raisers. It says, “I want to hear what you say,” even if Charlie’s

hand is up for the tenth time in twelve questions.

Teach Like a Champion Fourth, Cold Call will **help** you distribute work around the room not only

more fully (that is, beyond the hand raisers) but more authoritatively. One of its positive effects is that it establishes that the room belongs to you. Not only

will this allow you to reach out to individual students, but it will have a strong cultural effect in that it will draw out engagement. If I am pretty sure that at

some point in the next few hours or day you’re going to call on me to respond to our class work, I have a strong incentive to do that work in anticipation of this

probability. You have made me accountable. This is an incredibly powerful force. People sometimes ask, “Which one of these techniques should I do ﬁrst?” or “If

I can teach my teachers to do only one, which will make the biggest difference?” For the reasons I’ve described above, the single most powerful technique in this

book is, I believe, Cold Call. But while making a habit of calling on students regardless of whose hand is up is one of the most critical techniques you can use

to drive universal achievement, all cold calling is not equally effective. You can do it wrong; doing it right will ensure that it has the effect you intended. The

success of the technique relies on the application of a few key principles: • Cold Call is predictable. Cold calling is superb preventive medicine but

less effective as a cure. It is a way to keep students’ **attention** from drifting, but is not as effective once they’re off task. It’s an engagement strategy, not a

discipline strategy. If you cold call for a few

minutes of your class almost every day, students will come

to expect it and change their behavior in advance.

When a stimulus is predictable, it changes behavior by anticipation, not

just by reaction. If you cold call for a few minutes of your class almost every

day, students will come to expect it and change their behavior in advance; they

will prepare to be asked questions at any time by paying **attention** and readying

themselves mentally. If your cold calls surprise students, they may learn a **lesson** (“Darn, I should have been ready!”),

but this will be too late to **help** them. Unless they know there’ll surely be a next time very soon, they won’t have cause to change their behavior before you ask

your question. They may also feel ambushed, caught off guard, and therefore more likely to be thinking about the past (“Why’d she do that?”) than about the

future (“I’m going to be ready!”). If cold calls are predictable and students begin to anticipate them, the effect

will be universal. The possibility (indeed, the likelihood) of a cold call affects all students, not just those who actually get cold called. You want students to

react beforehand to the reliable possibility, not after the unpredictable fact. You Engaging Students in Your Lessons 115

want them always ready for the call that might come, not deciding after the fact to be ready for the next one. And you want all of them thinking that way.

Cold calling, then, should be part of the fabric of everyday life in your class. A little bit of it every day will have a stronger effect on classroom culture than a

great deal of intensive but inconsistent or unexpected cold calling. At some point in most lessons, students should be asked to participate regardless of whether they

have raised their hands. Furthermore, since the purpose of Cold Call is to engage students before

they tune out, many teachers ﬁnd that the beginning of class is the ideal time for this technique. This allows them to set the tone for the rest of the day and engage

students before they can become distracted. Cold Call is preventive medicine. Take it daily to keep the symptoms from ever appearing.

• Cold Call is systematic. Teachers who use Cold Call signal that these calls are about their expectations, not about individuals. They take pains to make

it clear that cold calls are universal (they come without fail to everyone) and impersonal (their tone, manner, and frequency emphasize that they are not an

effort to single out any student or students). The less a cold call carries emotion, the less it seems tied to what a student has or has not done, to whether you are

happy or disappointed with him, whether you think he did his homework. The message should ideally be, “This is how we do business here.” The

teachers interviewed for this book use Cold Call with an even, calm tone and spend a minimum amount of time appearing to hem and haw about which student

to call on. Questions come at students quickly, clearly, and calmly, in clusters directed to multiple students, in multiple locations around the room, rather than

focused on a single student or group of students in isolation. They should take in all types of students—not just those who might become off-task or who are

sitting in the back. After all, a cold call is not a punishment; it is a student’s chance, as Colleen Driggs puts it, “to shine.”

Some teachers emphasize the systematic nature of Cold Call by keeping visible charts tracking who’s been called on. What could send a clearer message

that everyone gets their share than a tracking system in which every name gets checked off in good time?

• Cold Call is positive. The purpose of Cold Call is to foster positive engagement in the work of your class, which ideally is rigorous work. One of

its beneﬁts is that students occasionally surprise themselves with what they are capable of. They do not volunteer because they do not think they can answer,

but when they are forced to try, they are happily surprised to ﬁnd themselves succeeding. In so doing they also beneﬁt from knowing that you thought they

could answer the question. You show your respect and faith in a student when you Teach Like a Champion

ask her to join the conversation. But this works only if your questions propose to ask students to contribute to a real conversation rather than to catch them out

and chasten them. This is the aspect of Cold Call that teachers are most likely to get wrong. There’s part of many of us that wants to use it as a “gotcha”—to

call on a student when we know he was tuned out to show him that fact or prove some sort of a **lesson** to him (“What did I just say, John?” or “Isn’t that right,

John?”). But this rarely works since causing a student to publicly founder on purpose and with no potential beneﬁt at stake is more likely to make him ask

questions about you (“Why’s she always picking on me?”) than about himself. The goal is for the student to

get the answer right, not learn a **lesson** by getting it wrong.

A positive cold call is the opposite of a gotcha in two ways. First, it is

substantive. “What did I just say?” is not a substantive question. It’s a gotcha,

designed to “teach a **lesson**” that in fact it rarely teaches. “Do you think Lincoln

declared war on the South primarily to eradicate slavery?” is a real question. “What is the subject in this sentence?” is a real question. You might ask a peer

such a question in the faculty room, and this shows that you respect the person of whom you are asking the question. Second, the goal is for the student to get

the answer right, not learn a **lesson** by getting it wrong. You want your students to succeed, to feel good and maybe even a little surprised by that success, even

while they are challenged and stretched by the healthy tension of Cold Call. Remember that Cold Call is an engagement technique, not a disciplinary tech-

nique. It keeps students on task and mentally engaged. Once a student is off task, the Cold Call opportunity has passed. Then you should use a behavioral

technique. You can ensure a positive cold call by asking questions that pertain to the

**lesson** and suggest you are making a genuine invitation to a student to participate in the conversation. Use Cold Call in an upbeat and positive tone, suggesting that

you couldn’t imagine a world in which a student would not want to participate. One ﬁnal aspect of Cold Call that leads to a positive tone occasionally eludes

some teachers when they aren’t prepared: the question and what an answer could look like should be clear. Every teacher has had the experience of asking a

student a question that in retrospect wasn’t clear, where even a well-informed and engaged student wouldn’t know what to say. It’s doubly important to avoid

this **kind** of question when cold calling, and many teachers address this challenge by planning their exact questions in advance and word for word as part of their

**lesson** planning process. Engaging Students in Your Lessons 117

• Cold Call is scaffolded. This technique is especially effective when you start with simple questions and progress to harder ones, drawing students in,

engaging them on terms that emphasize what they already know, and reinforcing basic knowledge before pushing for greater rigor and challenge. This will often

require “unbundling,” or breaking a single larger question up into a series of smaller questions.

Consider this sequence from the classroom of Darryl Williams as he teaches his third graders to identify the complete sentences from among a list of several

choices: Williams:

Read the next choice for me, please, Kyrese. Kyrese:

[reading from the worksheet] “Have you seen a pumpkin seed?” Williams:

Do we have a subject, Japhante? Japhante:

Yes. Williams:

What’s the subject? Japhante:

“You.” Williams:

“You.” Excellent. Do we have a predicate, Eric? Eric:

Yes. Williams:

What’s the predicate? Eric:

“Seen.” Williams:

“Seen.” Excellent. Is it a complete thought, Rayshawn? Rayshawn:

Yes. Williams:

Is that our complete sentence? Rayshawn:

Yes. Williams:

So we just keep going? What do we need to do, Shakaye? Shakaye:

We need to look at the other two [answer choices] because that might sound right but one of the other two might sound right too.

The sequence involves calling on ﬁve students in rapid succession and fol- lows a careful progression of increasing difﬁculty. The ﬁrst question merely asks

a student to read what’s in front of him. The difﬁculty level is low. Williams is Teach Like a Champion

scaffolding; anyone can get it right. The next question (“Is there a subject?”) is an incredibly simple yes-or-no question designed for the student of whom

it is asked to get it right. When he does, Williams comes back with the more difﬁcult question (“What is the subject?”), but that question now comes on the

heels of the student’s previous success and after Williams has engaged him in the process of thinking about sentence structure. After asking another student a

similar sequence, he goes on to harder questions about whether the sentence is complete and what strategy students should take next in answering the question.

By breaking the basic question, “Is it a complete sentence?” into smaller parts and starting with simple questions, Williams successfully engages students and

ensures their readiness when he asks more difﬁcult questions. By parsing the question out to ﬁve students instead of one, he also ensures fuller participation

and the expectation that participation is a predictable and systematic event. A more subtle method of scaffolding is to allow students to begin answering

cold calls about work that they have already done and have the answers in front of them. This again begins the sequence with something they are likely to get

right. Darryl Williams began his sequence of Cold Call above with a request to Kyrese to “read the next [answer] choice for me.” This engages the student at the

outset at a level where he is almost sure to succeed: he merely has to read what’s in front of him. Furthermore, a cold call that asks a student, “Please tell us your

answer to the ﬁrst problem, Milagros,” employs scaffolding because Milagros has done the work and has an answer in front of her. She begins by merely reporting

back on her work. Of course, a sequence that begins with such simple questions would ideally progress to more rigorous follow-up questions that did ask Milagros

or Kyrese to think on their feet. One of the misperceptions some teachers have about this technique is that it is only a way to ask simple questions. But its

questions should be as rigorous as you can make them—something students will come to take pride in as they see themselves able to handle demanding material

on the spur of the moment. Starting simple doesn’t mean ending that way, but it does tend to engage and motivate kids and cause students to be inspired by the

building level of rigor and challenge. Using Cold Call to follow up on previous comments in class underscores how

much you value students’ participation and insight. It also emphasizes that your students’ engagement in what their peers say is as important as their engagement

in what you say. There are three varieties to consider: •

Follow-on to a previous question. Ask a simple question using Cold Call —think of it as a warm-up—and then ask the student a short series of

further questions (most teachers ask two to four) in which her opinions are further developed or her understanding further tested.

Engaging Students in Your Lessons 119 •

Follow-on to another student’s comment. This reinforces the importance of listening to peers as well as teacher: “James says the setting is a dark sum-

mer night. Does that tell us everything we need to know about the setting, Susan?” or “What does exploit mean, Stephen? Good and who gets exploited

in Macbeth, Markeesha?” •

Follow-on to a student’s own earlier comment. This signals that once the stu- dent has spoken, she’s not done: “But, Yolanda, you said earlier that we always

multiplied length and width to ﬁnd area. Why didn’t we do that here?” Beyond these principles, there are several elements champion teachers apply,

vary, and adapt to maximize the beneﬁt of Cold Call in a wider variety of settings. These are key variations on the Cold Call theme:

• Hands Up/Hands Down. You can use Cold Call and continue allowing students to raise their hands if they wish, or you can instruct your students to keep

their hands down. Both versions emphasize different aspects of the technique. Taking hands allows you to continue encouraging and rewarding students

who ask to participate, even if you sometimes call on those who don’t have their hands raised. You merely move between taking hands and cold calling at your

discretion. This continues providing incentives to students to raise their hands while also allowing you to add sophistication to your scaffolding. When you’re

allowing hands during your cold calling, you can, say, cold call students for the ﬁrst three questions in a sequence and then save the capper, the last and

potentially the toughest or most interesting question, for a volunteer, thus differ- entiating **instruction** and making academic challenge a reward in and of itself.

One factor to consider in allowing students to raise their hands while you cold call is that it may cause your use of Cold Call to be less apparent and transparent

and thus less systematic. That’s because it may not always be obvious to students whether the classmate who got called on had her hand up or was cold called.

Taking hands also gives you an important data point. Even if you ignore it, it tells you who thinks they know well enough to volunteer. Thus, if you want to try to

call on students whose mastery is unsteady, you have a clearer idea of who to try. You can also decide to tell students to put their hands down, that you’re not

taking hands, and then proceed to cold call whomever you wish. This sends a more forceful message about your ﬁrm control of the classroom, and it makes

your cold calling more explicit, predictable, and transparent (“I’m cold calling now”). It also tends to make the pacing of your cold calling, and thus your **lesson**,

even faster because you don’t spend time navigating hands. Finally, hands down can be more effective for checking for understanding in two key ways. First, it

Teach Like a Champion reduces the likelihood of students’ calling out answers in eagerness. While truly

a sin of enthusiasm, calling out is corrosive to your classroom **environment** and speciﬁcally to your ability to steer questions to the students who need to work

or those you need to assess. Second, because students who do want to answer are rendered less visible (they don’t have their hands up), your decision to target

your checking for understanding of more reticent students is less patently visible and therefore seems a bit more systematic.

A last caveat is that most champion teachers appear to use both hands up and hands down as a matter of habit, with their choice determined by the situa-

tion. One possible reason for this is that using only hands up is not as forceful and energetic and using only hands down is a disincentive to hand raising over

the long run. With enough time, it risks convincing students not to bother rais- ing their hands at all, since doing so is never rewarded. In that case a teacher

had better really like Cold Call because she’ll have few hands offered and few alternatives.

Using this sequence—‘‘Ques- tion. Pause. Name.’’—ensures

that every student hears the question and begins preparing

an answer during the pause that you’ve provided.

. • Timing the Name. Cold Call can

vary in terms of when you say the name of the student you’re calling on. The

most common and often the most effec- tive approach is to ask the question,

pause, and then name a student, as in, “What’s 3 times 9? [pause], James?”

Using this sequence—“Question. Pause. Name.”—ensures

that every

student hears the question and begins preparing

an answer during the pause you’ve provided. Since students know a cold call is likely but not who will receive it, every student is likely to answer the question,

with one student merely called on to give their answer aloud. In the example, it means that every student in the class has done the multiplication in the pause

between question and name. If you say the name ﬁrst, twenty-four fewer students practice their multiplication. The difference in leverage between this scenario

(twenty-ﬁve students answering a question and one saying it aloud) and the alternative (one student answering a question and twenty-four watching) is so

dramatic that it should be the default approach to most of your cold calling. In some cases, calling a student’s name ﬁrst can be beneﬁcial. Often it can

prepare a student to attend and increases the likelihood of success. This can be especially effective with students who may not have been cold called before,

students who have language processing difﬁculties, or students whose knowledge of English is still developing. In its most exaggerated form, this is known as a

Engaging Students in Your Lessons 121 precall. In a precall, you tell a student that he or she can expect to be called

on later in the **lesson**. It can happen privately (a teacher might say to a student before class, “Okay, Jamal, I’m going to ask you to go over the last problem

from the homework today. Be ready!”) or publicly (“Paul’s going to give us the answer, Karen, but then I’ll be asking you why!”).

Another instance in which it is productive to state the name ﬁrst is for clarity. For example, if you are coming out of a sequence of Call and ****Response**** (the

following technique in this chapter), in which students have been calling out answers in unison, dropping in a name ﬁrst and then asking the question makes

it clear to students that you are no longer using Call and ****Response**** and thus avoids the awkward and counterproductive moment when some students attempt

to answer in unison a question you had intended for an individual. • Mix with other engagement techniques. Cold Call responds especially

well to mixing with other engagement techniques. Call and ****Response**** is a per- fect example: moving back and forth between whole group choral response and

individual responses at a rapid energetic pace can drive up the level of positive energy dramatically. It can also allow you to ensure that students aren’t coasting

during Call and ****Response****. To take a simple example, you could review multi- plication tables with your students by asking everyone to call out answers to a

few problems: ****Teacher****:

Class, what’s 9 times 7? Class:

63! ****Teacher****:

Good what’s 9 times 8? Class:

72! ****Teacher****:

Good, now Charlie, What’s 9 times 9? Class:

81! ****Teacher****:

Good. What’s 9 times 9, class? Class:

81! ****Teacher****:

Good and, Matilda, what was 9 times 7 again? Matilda:

63! By toggling back and forth, you can cause individual students to review material

or reinforce a successful answer by having the class repeat it. Teach Like a Champion

Pepper (technique 24, later in this chapter) is another engagement technique that works well with Cold Call. In fact it’s very similar to Cold Call in that

it consists of rapid-ﬁre questions that are often cold called. Finally, Everybody Writes (technique 25, later in this chapter) is a preparation for Cold Call, as

it allows everyone to prethink the topic or questions you’ll be addressing; this increases the likely quality of responses.

Teachers often conclude that Cold Call questions must be simple. In fact, Cold Call questions can and should be rigorous and demanding. Part of their

power lies in having students feel the pride of answering demanding questions at the spur of the moment. Following is a transcript of a session of Cold Call

executed by Jesse Rector of North Star Academy’s Clinton Hill campus. Rector is an exceptional math teacher with exceptional results and a following within

our organization for his craft. The rigor of his questioning shows why. See how many of the following Cold Call questions, asked of seventh graders in rapid-ﬁre

succession, you’d get correct. Rector:

I’m a square ﬁeld with an area of 169 square feet. What’s the length of one of my sides, Janae?

Janae: 13.

Rector: 13 what? [Asking Janae for the units is an example of Format Matters,

technique 4.] Janae:

13 feet. Rector:

I’m a square ﬁeld with a perimeter of 48 feet. What’s my area, Kat- rina?

Katrina: 144 square feet.

Rector: Excellent. I’m a regular octagon with a side that measures 8x plus 2.

What is my perimeter, Tamisse? Tamisse:

64x plus 16. Rector:

Excellent. I am an isosceles triangle with two angles that measure 3x each. What is the measure of my third angle, Anaya?

Anaya: 180 degrees minus 6x.

Engaging Students in Your Lessons 123 Rector:

Excellent, 180 degrees minus 6x. The square root of 400 is what, Frank?

Frank: 100.

Rector: No, the square root of 400 isn’t 100. Help him out.

David: 20.

Rector: That’s right; it’s 20. Tell him why.

David: Because if you multiply 20 by 20, you’ll get 400.

In clip 7 on the DVD, Jesse Rector is modeling Cold Call. You’ll notice

that his students are standing up; this makes the fact that he’s going to use Cold Call obvious or, in the language of the technique, ‘‘predictable.’’

Jesse gives the lie to that notion. To prove it, just try to keep up with his seventh graders yourself in answering the questions. This is also a good

example of Pepper: a signiﬁcant quantity of questions (not necessarily cold calls, though in this case they are) asked rapidly around a given number of

themes (geometry and square roots here), with little discussion in between. You can read more about Pepper later in this chapter. After you’ve done

so, rewatch Jesse’s video and see how he puts both techniques to work. The ﬁrst time you use Cold Call, your students may wonder what’s going on,

and with some justiﬁcation. They may have never been cold called before. They may not have been in a classroom where that **kind** of thing happened. They might

not see the connection between Cold Call and their getting to college, say, or they might be inclined to see it as a negative rather than a positive situation. Thus,

it’s a good idea to script some brief remarks—in essence, a rollout speech—to use the ﬁrst time with Cold Call. Your brief remarks can explain the what and

why. This makes the exercise rational, systematic, predictable, and, with a little skill, inspiring.

Teach Like a Champion

# See it in action: clip 8

# Cold call

In clip 8 on the DVD, Colleen Driggs of Rochester Prep is modeling her

rollout speech for Cold Call. Many teachers assume cold calls have to be stressful for students, that they’ll be forced to participate when they

don’t want to. But your expectations of students’ interest are often a self-fulﬁlling prophecy. As you watch Driggs, make a list of the things she

says that you could borrow or adapt if you gave a rollout speech to explain cold calling to your students (and, I hope, tried to underscore what a good

thing it is). A rollout speech could be useful for any number of techniques and

skills, not just Cold Call. A few that jump to my mind are Right Is Right (technique 2), No Opt Out (technique 1), Control the Game (Chapter Ten),

and Do It Again (technique 39). In this sequence Colleen quickly tells her students how to act during

Cold Call, explains why she uses this technique, and frames the activity in a positive way: a chance to show off.

. Elm City College Prep’s Summer Payne introduces Cold Call to her kinder-

garteners by renaming it. To a cheery little tune, she sings: “Individual turns! Listen for your name!” And her kids, like Colleen’s, love Cold Call. If you

present it positively, yours will too.

# See it in action: clip 9

# Cold call and vocabulary

In clip 9 on the DVD, Beth Verilli of North Star Academy demonstrates

exemplary teaching of Cold Call and ****Vocabulary**** (discussed in Chapter Eleven).

Verilli’s class is an eleventh- and twelfth-grade Advanced Placement English class (thus the small class size). Notice how her use of Cold Call

stresses follow-ons. She repeatedly cold calls students to respond to or Engaging Students in Your Lessons 125

give examples of a previous student’s answer. This builds a level of strong accountability into a mature peer-to-peer culture that’s especially useful

with older students. It also boosts the rigor of the classroom and keeps the pacing strong.

In terms of ****Vocabulary****, notice how many times students use and apply some version of the word exploit and use it in slightly different forms

(‘‘exploit,’’ ‘‘exploits,’’ and ‘‘exploited’’) in settings where both people (Macbeth) and abstract concepts (Duncan’s trust) are exploited. If the goal

of vocabulary **instruction** is for students to have a deep meaning of the word and the ability to apply it correctly in multiple settings (in terms of

both syntax and meaning), Verilli’s students have leaped forward toward that goal in a very short span of time.

# Technique 23

# Call and response

The basic element of Call and ****Response**** is that you ask a question and the whole

class calls out the answer in unison. It sounds simple, but when it is effectively used in all its variations, Call and ****Response**** can be an exceptional tool not only

to engage students but to **help** them achieve. Effective Call and ****Response**** can be accomplish three primary goals:

• Academic review and reinforcement. Having students respond as a group

ensures that everyone gets to give the answer. Everyone swings at the pitch, and the number of at bats multiplies by twenty-ﬁve to thirty. When an indi-

vidual student gives a strong answer, asking the rest of the class to repeat that answer is also an effective way to reinforce it. The whole class repeats the

insight and reinforces for the original student how important what he or she said was.

• High-energy fun. Call and ****Response**** is energetic, active, and spirited. It feels

lively, like being part of a cheering crowd or an exercise class. Generally par- ticipants like cheering in crowds and going to exercise classes because they

ﬁnd them energizing. Call and ****Response**** can make your class similarly invig- orating and make students want to be there.

Teach Like a Champion Students don’t see Call and

****Response**** as behavioral reinforcement, but it makes

crisp, active, timely compliance a habit,

committing it to muscle memory.

. •

Behavioral reinforcement. There’s an outstanding hidden beneﬁt to Call

and ****Response****: students respond to a prompt as a group, exactly on cue,

over and over again. And it makes this **kind** of on-cue compliance pub-

lic. Everyone sees everyone else doing it. You ask; they do, over and

over again. Students don’t see Call and ****Response**** as behavioral rein-

forcement, but it makes crisp, active, timely compliance a habit, committing it to muscle memory. This reinforces

the teacher’s authority and command. Although Call and ****Response**** is a fairly straightforward technique, it’s easy to

underestimate it, focusing on its most simplistic forms: asking students to repeat aphorisms and chants, for example. In fact, there are ﬁve types or levels of Call

and ****Response**** sequence, listed next roughly in order of intellectual rigor, from least to greatest:

1. Repeat: In these sequences, students repeat what their teacher has said or

complete a familiar phrase that he or she starts. The topic of the phrase can be behavioral (“Who are we??!! [South Side Prep!] What are we here

to do? [To learn and achieve!]” ) or academic (“When we see a zero, the pattern . . . [stops and begins again] the pattern . . . [stops and begins again]”).

2. Report: Students who have already completed problems or questions on their

own are asked to report their answers back (“On three, tell me your answer to problem number three”). This version allows you to more energetically

reinforce academic work once it’s been completed. 3.

Reinforce: You reinforce new information or a strong answer by asking the class to repeat it: “Can anyone tell me what this part of the expression

is called? Yes, Trayvon, that’s the exponent. Class, what’s this part of the expression called?” Everyone has an additional active **interaction** with

critical new **content**, and when a student provides the information, Call and ****Response**** reinforces the importance of the answer (“My answer was so

important my teacher asked the whole class to repeat it”). 4.

Review: This asks students to review answers or information from earlier in the class or unit: “Who was the ﬁrst person Theseus met on the road to

Engaging Students in Your Lessons 127 Athens, class? Who was the second person? And now who’s the third?” or

“What vocabulary word did we say meant not having enough of something?” 5.

Solve: This is the most challenging to do well and the most rigorous. The teacher asks students to solve a problem and call out the answer in unison: “If

the length is ten inches and the width is twelve inches, the area of our rect- angle must be how many square inches, class?” The challenge is that when

having a group of people solve a problem in real time and call out the answer, there must be a single clear answer and a strong likelihood that all students

will know how to solve it. With those caveats in mind, this type of Call and ****Response**** call be highly rigorous, and students often surprise themselves at

their ability to solve problems in real time. To be effective in any form, Call and ****Response**** should be universal, that

is, all students should respond. To ensure that this is the case, plan to use a speciﬁc signal (“Class!” “Everybody!” “One, Two . . . ,” or even a nonverbal

signal such as a ﬁnger point) to indicate your desire to have students respond in unison. Such a signal, called an in-cue, makes it clear when you are asking

students to call out as a group and when you are asking for students to wait until you’ve identiﬁed a student to answer. This is critically important. Every student

should know whether a question you’ve asked is: •

Rhetorical: “Is 42 divided by 7 going to be 5?” •

About to be directed to a single child: “42 divided by 7 is what, Shane?” •

Awaiting a volunteer: “Who can tell me what 42 divided by 7 is?” •

Asked in anticipation of full class call and response: “Class, 42 divided by 7 is . . . ”

If students don’t know how to quickly and reliably differentiate your expec- tations in these four cases, you will lose your ability to intentionally use any of

these techniques at your sole discretion. Instead, it will fall to each member of the class to infer which of the above he or she thinks is (or would like have)

applicable at any time. If that happens, you lose your ability to choose between checking for understanding with speciﬁc individual students using Cold Call,

engaging all students, reinforcing an eager hand raiser, choosing just the student you think will be insightful, ensuring wait time for reﬂection before you take an

answer, or any of a dozen other tricks of good teaching. In short, you need to have students know what **kind** of answer you expect. Furthermore, who doesn’t

Teach Like a Champion shudder at the thought of being at a party speaking loudly over music when all

of a sudden the music goes silent and they alone are left shouting their thoughts to a suddenly quiet room? For students to participate enthusiastically in Call

and ****Response****, they must conﬁdently and clearly know when to sing out because everyone will be singing out and know as well they need not fear they will be the

only one singing. Thus, for Call and ****Response**** to succeed, you must use a reliable and consistent signal and make 100 percent participation the rule. A good in-cue

is the key to achieving this so it’s worth spending a little more time on the topic. There are ﬁve speciﬁc kinds of in-cues that champion teachers use.

The ﬁrst **kind** of in-cue is count-based, for example, “Ready, set . . . ,” “One, two . . . ,” or “One, two, ready, you . . . ” These have the advantage of giving

students time to get ready to answer and, in classrooms where Call and ****Response**** is especially energetic, to breathe in and prepare to sing out in their loudest voice.

They also **help** you ensure that students answer in unison and exactly on cue so these prompts can be particularly effective in building a strong, positive culture.

Count-based cues are highly effective in that they can be cut short if students are not fully attentive or on-task in the lead-up to the Call and ****Response****. In other

words, a count of, “One two, ready, you!” can occasionally be cut off by the teacher (“One two . . . no I don’t have everyone”) to show students they’re not

ready while maintaining the anticipation of the fun that’s to come. Finally, you can speed them up or slow them down as necessary to set the pace you desire.

Effective teachers may start with a longer count-based cue and gradually trun- cate it as students become familiar with it to save time. “One, two, ready, you!”

may become simply “One, two!” The resulting saved second of class time speeds up the pace of **instruction** and allocates more time to teaching. That may sound

trivial, but an in-cue that’s a second shorter, repeated ten times a day over two hundred days, buys you half an hour of instructional time. In some classrooms,

even this shorter version is sometimes replaced by a nonverbal cue to expedite it. A second form of in-cue is the group prompt. Two common examples are,

“Everybody!” and “Class!” as in, “What’s the name of the answer to an addition problem, everybody?” Or, “Class, what’s the greatest common factor of 10 and

16?” Using a collective term for the whole class helps foster group identity, and these prompts remind students of your expectation. Saying the word everybody

reminds students that you expect universal participation, and should you fail to get it, allows you to repeat the sequence by merely repeating the word with

slightly greater emphasis: “everybody.” Champion teachers are often strategic about whether they put the prompt before the question or after. Saying, “What’s

the name of the answer to an addition problem, everybody?” gives students time to hear and process the question before they answer, especially if there’s a slight

Engaging Students in Your Lessons 129 pause between question and prompt. This carries a slightly different emphasis

from, “Everybody, what’s the name of the answer to an addition problem?” The former starts with the **content**, the latter with the expectation about who’s going

to answer. A third **kind** of in-cue is a nonverbal gesture: a point, a hand dropped from

shoulder height, a looping motion with the ﬁnger. These have the advantage of speed and don’t require you to interrupt the ﬂow of the **lesson**. If used consis-

tently, they can be powerful. They can also be challenging in that the tone has to be just right or they can seem schoolmarmish. (Imagine how a teacher snapping

when she wants her class to answer aloud could sound wrong; at the same time, I have seen teachers use this method with great success.) It’s also easy to slip

on consistency with nonverbal signals, a tendency that can give rise to long-term challenges. Nevertheless, this is the choice of many top teachers.

A fourth **kind** of in-cue employs a shift in tone and volume. The teacher increases volume in the last few words of a sentence and inﬂects his or her tone

to imply a question; students recognize this as a prompt and respond crisply. This method is by far the trickiest in-cue and the most prone to error. It’s most

often one that teachers begin using after mastering the simpler methods over time. It has the advantage of being seamless, fast, and natural, but you probably

shouldn’t use this as you are developing this skill. Furthermore, if you rely on it, you should expect a certain number of miscues to occur. In that case, you should

have an in-cue of one of the above types ready as a backup to use to respond if students miss a cue.

The last **kind** of in-cue is specialized: it indicates a speciﬁc response to students. In many classrooms that use these, there are multiple such cues, each

indicating a different response. For example, Bob Zimmerli teaches his students a song listing the multiples of all of the numbers up to 12. After he has taught them

these songs, he can prompt them with specialized cues. If he says, for example, “Sevens on two. One, two . . . ” his students will respond by singing, “7, 14, 21,

28, 35, 42 . . . ” to the tune of a popular song. If he says, “Eights on two. One, two . . . ” his students will respond with a different song and different numbers.

Or, in a different example, you might teach your students to always respond to the in-cue, “Why are we here?” with the response, “To learn! To achieve!” Once the

students learned that connection, you would no longer have to offer a reminder that you were expecting a response (“Ready, everyone?”). You would suddenly

say, “Why are we here?” and your students would be chanting. This form of in- cue can be especially fun for teachers and students. There’s something exciting

about a teacher asking a seemingly innocuous question, and then suddenly the whole class is singing and chanting in unison.

Teach Like a Champion Teachers have developed a wide variety of wrinkles that add value to Call

and ****Response**** and make it useful in particular situations. Here are three especially effective ways to adapt and apply this technique:

• Combine and intersperse it with Cold Call. Varying group and individual

accountability to answer increases students’ level of **attention** and taps into the tension of the unexpected, making class more exciting for students.

• Jazz up your Call and ****Response**** by asking subgroups within the class to

respond in unison to some cues. For example, ask the boys a Call and ****Response**** question and then the girls, the left side of the room and then the

right, the front and then the back. This unexpected twist makes the technique more interesting and unexpected for students, factors that are likely to engage

them more fully in class. •

Add a physical gesture: students cross their ﬁngers in a mock addition sign as they call out the name for the answer to an addition problem: “The product!”

They point their ﬁngers at the sky and chant, “On the roof!” when asked where the numbers they carry go in an addition problem. By sometimes including a

physical gesture, teachers gain two advantages: they give students a way to be physically active in class, which keeps them alert and moving and gives them

something positive to do, not just say. For students who struggle to sit still, this is a great relief. By adding a visual cue, especially one that’s not random but

where the gesture reﬂects the correct answer (the crossed ﬁngers), the teacher is better able to watch for students who are hiding while others participate and

increases his ability to assess students’ level of understanding.

# Key idea

# Call and response

Use

group choral

response—you ask;

they answer

in unison—to

build a

culture of

energetic, positive

engagement. Effectively implemented, Call and ****Response**** can engage all students at once

in an exciting, energetic, and motivating activity that energizes the class. It is Engaging Students in Your Lessons 131

extremely useful as part of a larger engagement strategy, and it has positive ancillary behavioral effects. It builds the habit of compliance in a subtle but

powerful way. When they participate in Call and ****Response****, students make a habit of doing what the teacher has asked, over and over again, without even

realizing they are practicing that skill. However, Call and ****Response**** has risks and downsides that every teacher should be aware of:

• It can allow freeloading. If I don’t know the answer or don’t want to partici-

pate, I can move my lips and fake it. If you’re concerned about freeloading, consider adding a gesture to the response, which gives both an auditory and a

visual way to test for participation. •

It does not provide effective checking for understanding. In the excitement of many students answering correctly, students who are lost can easily hide,

mouthing answers or watching their peers and joining in for second and third repetitions.

• It reinforces the behavioral culture in your classroom only if it’s crisp. If

students sense that they can use their responses to test your expectations by dragging out their answers, answering in a silly or loud manner, or answer-

ing out of sync, they will. Therefore, you must make sharpening up a priority. When the response to your call is any of those, you should energetically and

positively correct with something like: “I like your energy, but I need to hear you respond right on cue. Let’s try that again.”

# Technique 24

# Pepper

For decades baseball players have warmed up for games and practices by playing

a game called Pepper. In a group of four or ﬁve players, one holds a bat, and the rest stand in a ring in front of the batter, a few yards away, gloves at the ready.

One player tosses the ball to the batter. Without stopping to catch it, the batter taps it back toward the group using the bat; the nearest player ﬁelds it and, again

without stopping, tosses it back to the batter, who hits the toss back to another player. The game is fast, providing dozens of opportunities to practice ﬁelding

and hitting skills in a short period of time and in a fast-paced and energetic **environment**. Unlike formal practice, it doesn’t propose to teach new skills or

game strategy; it’s a reinforcement of skills. Teach Like a Champion

Pepper, the teaching technique by the same name, also uses fast-paced, group-oriented activities to review familiar information and foundational skills.

A teacher tosses questions to a group of students quickly, and they answer back. The teacher usually does not slow down to engage or discuss an answer; if it’s

right, she simply asks another student a new question. If it’s wrong, she asks the same question of another student, though sometimes the same student, always

keeping moving. That’s Pepper: a fast-paced, unpredictable (in real Pepper, you never know who’s going to get the ball) review of fundamentals with lots of

chances for participation in rapid succession. Pepper is a great warm-up activity. Many teachers include it as part of daily

oral drill at the outset of class, but it is also effective as an upbeat interlude to bring energy to the class, or as an energetic part of a review, perhaps wrapping up

to go over material one more time before an assessment. It’s perfect for ﬁlling in a stray ten minutes inside or outside the classroom with productive, engaging fun.

Since one challenge of Pepper is that it’s easily confused with Cold Call, looking at some of the ways Pepper is different is a good way to get to the next

level of speciﬁcity about the technique. First, although Pepper often involves Cold Call, it doesn’t have to. With

Pepper, you can take hands if you prefer, calling on volunteers quickly and energetically, either from the outset or after a brief period of Cold Call to engage

students. Most typically I see it happen in the latter way: the game starts out with Cold Call, but as students get engaged and enthused, they begin raising

their hands, often eagerly, at which point, the teacher makes a transition into a version of Pepper that involves almost all students in volunteering.

Second, Pepper almost always asks quick fundamental questions, often as review. This is different from Cold Call, which can involve questions at any

level or type. You’d be ﬁne cold calling a student to discuss the primary causes of the Civil War but less likely to cover that material in a game of Pepper. Since

Pepper is often a means for review, teachers move from unit to unit within the game. They’ll ask questions about properties of quadrilaterals for two or three

minutes and then move on to a series of questions about coordinate geometry. And they often do this even if the topics are not entirely related. In a social

studies class, you could spend a few minutes on map skills followed by a few minutes on the original colonies.

Third, Pepper is a game. (Baseball players love their version of Pepper because it’s a break from practice.) Thus, classroom Pepper uses indicators

that underscore for your class that they are playing a game. In some cases, this might mean that you ask all students to stand up, or you might call on

Engaging Students in Your Lessons 133 students in a unique way—something you might not do outside the game. In

Pepper, time is compressed, and the game has a clear end and beginning. Here are several variations that teachers use that emphasize the fun aspects of the

technique: •

Pick sticks. A trademark of Pepper is its unpredictability: where each question goes, nobody knows. Many teachers take this a step further and use devices to

engineer the randomization, most frequently using popsicle sticks labeled with each student’s name (and why they are called pick sticks) pulled at random out

of a can, for example, but also including other variations, such as random num- ber generation on a laptop. In such a system, teachers are in most cases relying

on apparent random assignment of participation. Whether or not students rec- ognize it, a teacher pulling pick sticks retains the ability to steer questions as

desired. One teacher’s advice explains what I mean: “Remember, only you know whose name is really on the popsicle stick!” You can pick John’s stick

but call out Susan’s name. Picking a stick has the disadvantage of taking as much time as asking a question: it slows you down by half.

# See it in action: clip 10

# Pepper and every minute matters

In clip 10 on the DVD, Annette Rifﬂe of North Star Academy demonstrates

Pepper. The most compelling aspect of this scene is not just Rifﬂe’s use of rapid-ﬁre questions in fast succession, as Pepper dictates, but the

way she makes efﬁcient, or more precisely urgent, use of time. In her classroom, every minute matters (see Chapter Eight on the technique by

this name)—even the minute when a student does her work at the board can be maximized.

• Head-to-head. A teacher using head-to-head begins by having two students

stand up to answer a question. The student who gets the correct answer ﬁrst remains standing to compete against a new challenger. What this technique

gives up in predictability, it makes up for in the beneﬁts of a friendly com- petition. In using this part of the technique, emphasize the same aspects of

Teach Like a Champion regular Pepper: fast pace, short and simple questions on fundamentals, and

limited engagement with wrong answers. Competition makes it easy to get too involved in discussing and even arbitrating right from wrong (“But I said

that!”). The best teachers just keep moving and don’t engage such distrac- tions. Otherwise there’s too much talking about that game and not enough

playing it. •

Sit down. This variation, usually done at the beginning of class, starts with all students standing and the teacher peppering them with the trademark quick

questions. Students “earn their seats” (get to sit down) by answering correctly. Again the teacher does not engage answers except to signal with a gesture

that a student may be seated. This game can be played in reverse (stand up) to determine the lining-up order for lunch, say.

Since Pepper is about speed, you’ll rarely see teachers stopping to discuss and analyze wrong answers. They may ask other students to correct them, but

the goal is almost always to keep the pace moving.

# Technique 25

# Wait time

Another technique to tap into the power of ideas and students that aren’t the

ﬁrst to emerge when you ask a question is Wait Time—delaying a few strategic seconds after you ﬁnish asking a question and before you ask a student to begin

answering it. Mary Budd Rowe, a professor of education at the University of Florida until her death in 1996, pioneered research into wait time and showed

that the typical teacher allows about a second of it after a question and allows for more than one and half seconds before taking an answer.

The challenges and limitations posed by such a habit are signiﬁcant. The answers you can expect to get after less than a second’s reﬂection are unlikely

to be the richest, the most reﬂective, or the most developed your students can generate. And taking answers after just a second systematically encourages stu-

dents to raise their hand with the ﬁrst answer—rather than the best one—they can think of if they want to reasonably hope to participate. Finally, this lack of

wait time makes it more likely that you will waste time processing a poor answer before you get to discuss a good one. Ironically, waiting and ensuring that you

spend your time on higher-quality initial answers may actually save you time. Engaging Students in Your Lessons 135

Minds work fast, and the amount of additional time

necessary to improve the quality of answers may be

small. Minds work fast, and the amount of

additional time necessary to improve the quality of answers may be small. Some

research has shown that when students are given just three to ﬁve seconds of

wait time after a question, several key things are likely to happen:

• The length and correctness of student responses are likely to increase.

• The number of failures to respond (those who say, “I don’t know”) is likely to

decrease. •

The number of students who volunteer to answer is likely to increase. •

The use of evidence in answers is likely to increase. But waiting is not quite as simple as merely pausing or counting to three

in your mind. First, it is hard to discipline yourself to allow time to pass after a question, and doing nothing does not necessarily **help** you to do that well.

Second, and more important, it is not necessarily apparent to students how they should respond to your waiting, especially when they have not spent signiﬁcant

time in schools that expect or train for rigorous reﬂection or that can even sustain a behavioral **environment** where reﬂection, rather than gooﬁng off, is likely to

ﬁll the space between question and answer. While you are training and acculturating your students to become scholars

and habituate the behaviors that yield success, you should consider enhancing your use of Wait Time by narrating it. Teachers who use this Narrated Wait

Time make the technique more intentional and productive—that is, more likely to result in the possible positive outcomes that can occur when Wait Time is

used. They provide guidance to their students about what they should be doing with their three seconds to be most productive. They tacitly explain why they’re

waiting and tell them—for example: 1.

“I’m waiting for more hands.” 2.

“I’d like to see at least ﬁfteen hands before we hear an answer.” 3.

“I’m waiting for someone who can connect this scene to another play, ideally Macbeth.”

Teach Like a Champion 4.

“I’m going to give everyone lots of time because this question is tricky. Your ﬁrst answer may not be the best.”

5. “I’m seeing people thinking deeply and jotting down thoughts. I’ll give

everyone a few more seconds to do that.” 6.

“I’m seeing people going back to the chapter to see if they can ﬁnd the scene. That seems like a great idea.”

7. “I’m looking for someone who’s pointing to the place in the passage where

you can ﬁnd the answer.” 8.

“I’ll start taking answers is ten seconds.” 9.

“I’m starting to see more hands now. Four, ﬁve, seven. Great. People are really starting to get comfortable taking a risk here.”

Notice the different emphasis of this narrated sequence. The ﬁrst merely suggests that the teacher would like to see more students participate. The second sets a

group goal for participation and, through use of we, makes answering the question a collective project. The third gives the students something speciﬁc and useful

to reﬂect on: how this scene is connected to something else they have read. In other words, what would an especially useful answer look like? The fourth pushes

students to double-check themselves and develop at least one second possibility. The ﬁfth narrates practical forms of productive activity by students in the class

(jotting down thoughts) and suggests to other students that they try this as well. Again, it stresses how to be productive during the wait time. The sixth chooses

a similarly productive activity to engage in during wait time to generate and research ideas. This one increases the likelihood that the teacher will receive an

evidence-based answer from her students. The seventh has a similar emphasis but asks students to afﬁrm that they have done the productive work in the interim

by pointing to the answer. It also increases the reliability with which the teacher can intentionally choose a correct or an incorrect answer. The eighth allows the

teachers to give students an extended answer period (it could be longer if she wished) by establishing a clear end point. The ninth narrates positive behavior

to normalize it (to make it seem typical) and encourages the risk of trying when you aren’t sure of the answer.

The point is that top teachers use their narration of the interim period during their wait time to incent and reinforce the speciﬁc behaviors that will be most

productive to their students during that time. They are teaching even while they are waiting.

# Wait time

In clip 11 on the DVD, Colleen Driggs of Rochester Prep models Wait Time.

She asks what genre a story her students have just read is most similar to. Her goal is to cause the students to think actively about the story and

review and assess a variety of options before choosing the best answer. Work like that takes time, and students have to use their time wisely. So in

addition to waiting almost twenty seconds between her question and the student she calls on, she provides guidance about how to use that precious

time to be strong students: •

‘‘You can go back and use your notes if you need to.’’ Message: Make a habit of using your notes to **help** answer questions.

• ‘‘I’ll give you some think time.’’ Message: This answer should take some

time and requires you to think about it. •

To one student: ‘‘Good job going back and using your notes.’’ Message: Emphasizes how to use Wait Time productively. This is also a strong

example of a key element of Precise Praise (technique 44 in Chapter Seven): praising replicable student behaviors.

# Technique 26

# Everybody writes

I recently watched a rigorous tenth-grade reading **lesson** at the highly successful

Boston Collegiate High ****School****. The teacher led her students though a discussion of Tim O’Brien’s narratively complex short story, “The Man I Killed,” from

his book The Things They Carried. In the story, the narrator (perhaps O’Brien, perhaps not) describes in the ﬁrst person his own inability to talk to others about

killing an enemy combatant during the Vietnam War. In one of the culminating moments of the **lesson**, the teacher asked students an astute and demanding

question: “Why would someone write a story about not being able to talk about Teach Like a Champion

what he did, and in so doing, talk about it? Why would he talk about not being able to talk about it?”

I was struck by two things: ﬁrst by how lucky the students were to be in a classroom with a teacher who asked demanding and perceptive questions in full

faith that they could answer them. Second I was struck by the students’ response, which was silence. They looked somewhat blankly at the teacher, and she, in

the end, stepped in and gave them a very nice summary of her thinking as to the answer. It was a ﬁne summary but not a successful discussion, and the result

was a lower ratio: the teacher did the cognitive work. Looking at the students as they struggled with the question, I was struck by

the paradox of their earnest confusion. No students rolled their eyes; none looked longingly out the window and disengaged. They wanted to answer, some of them

even craning forward as if to await some insight. And then they averted their eyes in hopes that the teacher wouldn’t call on them. This was a watershed moment:

the teacher asked exactly the **kind** of question that pushes students beyond their current understanding and knowledge of literature, the **kind** of question that

exempliﬁed true college preparatory expectations, and she was rewarded with a great silence descending.

Is there any way around such a paradox? To answer, I have to consider what it would take for me to answer the teacher’s question. The answer is that I

would need a minute, even half a minute, to think and, more important, to write: to jot down my thoughts and wrestle them into words. With time to reﬂect and

begin turning thoughts into words, I’d have the best chance of being ready to participate and, ideally, at some level of depth, because my ideas would be better

and I would be more conﬁdent in them.

# Key idea

# Everybody writes

Set your students up for rigorous engagement by giving

them the opportunity to reﬂect ﬁrst in writing before dis- cussing. As author Joan Didion says, ‘‘I write to know what I

think.’’ Engaging Students in Your Lessons 139

Like Joan Didion, I often have to write to know what I think. In college, writing papers at the fringes of my understanding, I sometimes did not truly

understand what my thesis was until I had written it. Only when the paper was done would my ideas have crystallized and coalesced in some organized form.

In retrospect, my participation in discussions of literature would have been ten times better if they’d happened after I wrote the paper, a fact I recognized when

one of the best professors I studied with required of his students a short written reﬂection as the entry ticket to each day’s class. In that class, where everybody

wrote ﬁrst, the conversation started where it ended in other classes. Another of my best professors described a “notion” as something two steps shy of an idea.

Like many other students, I spent a lot of time talking about notions in college, and, I’d argue, it’s in the writing that the ideas emerge.

Effective teachers also set their students up to hold rigorous discussions and reach rigorous conclusions by giving them the opportunity to reﬂect ﬁrst

in writing before discussing. This is the rationale behind Everybody Writes, a technique in which teachers ask all students to prepare for more ambitious

thinking and discussion by reﬂecting in writing for a short interval. In a broader sense, most class discussions are structured, unwittingly, around

the false assumption that the ﬁrst ideas to be generated or the ﬁrst students to raise their hands will be the ones most conducive to a productive conversation:

ask a question, call on a hand. But the ﬁrst answer is not always the best answer. Some students require time to generate worthy ideas or to feel conﬁdent enough

in their ideas to offer to share them. Ideas get better even for the students whose hands shoot right up when they beneﬁt from a few moments of reﬂection.

There are at least six beneﬁts to Everybody Writes: 1.

It often allows you to select effective responses to begin your discussion since you can review your students’ ideas in advance by circulating and reading

over shoulders. 2.

It allows you to cold call students simply and naturally since you know every- one is prepared with thoughts and you can merely ask, “What did you write

about, Ariel?” to kick things off. 3.

It allows you to give every student, not just those who can get their hands up fast, the chance to be part of the conversation.

4. Processing thoughts in writing reﬁnes them, a process that challenges stu-

dents intellectually, engages them, and improves the quality of their ideas and their writing.

Teach Like a Champion 5.

You set standards or steer students in a direction you think especially fruitful. For example, you could advise them to write a sentence deﬁning the vocab-

ulary word imperceptible and ask them to ensure that their sentence makes it clear that imperceptible is different from invisible. Or you could ask students

to describe what the Capulets think of the Montagues in Romeo and Juliet and then push them to understand the intensity of the hatred by asking them

to write their answer in the words a member of the family would use. 6.

Students remember twice as much of what they are learning if they write it down.

With all these advantages to writing, it’s worth looking for every opportunity to have your students write—not just to improve their writing but to improve

the quality of the thinking that informs discussions at key points in the **lesson**.

# See it in action: clip 12

# Everybody writes

In clip 12 on the DVD, Art Worrell of North Star Academy demonstrates

Everybody Writes. He begins the sequence by asking his class a deep and challenging question: ‘‘What are some of the characteristics or qualities

that an individual must have to change history?’’ This is a truly rich and important question to ask, but ask yourself what the very ﬁrst student to

raise his or her hand would say without reﬂection. What would the quality of the answer and the subsequent discussion be, and how ready would

students be to ground their arguments in evidence? Worrell anticipates this and asks all of his students to begin writing

answers. He asks them to brainstorm ‘‘two to three characteristics that an individual must have.’’ This direction is critical and underscores the power

of this technique. If you take answers without asking everybody to write, you can really ask students to think of and keep only one answer in their

heads. Everybody Writes allows Worrell to instantly increase the rigor and amount of thinking students do and also to stress the important fact that

there are many answers. Notice also Worrell’s level of preparation. He has given them space

in their notes packets to brainstorm. This reduces the transaction cost of Engaging Students in Your Lessons 141

the activity (no fumbling around looking for scrap paper) and ensures that students will retain a record of their thinking. And of course the proof

is in the pudding: lots of volunteers to answer (and if there weren’t an easy way to cold call) and high-quality answers that will lead to a rich

discussion. .

These six beneﬁts work on at least three axes: they increase the quality of the ideas discussed in your class and expand the number of students likely to

participate and their readiness to do so. And regardless of who actually speaks up, the exercise increases the ratio since it causes everybody to answer the

question, not just those who discuss.

# Technique 27

# Vegas

Vegas isn’t sparkle-for-

sparkle’s sake. It reinforces not just academics generally

but one of the day’s learning objectives.

“Every **lesson** needs a little Vegas,” Dave Levin, founder and leader of

the high-achieving KIPP schools has observed. The Vegas is the sparkle, the

moment during class when you might observe some production values: music,

lights, rhythm, dancing. Vegas draws students into a little bit of magic. But

don’t be fooled: Vegas isn’t sparkle-for- sparkle’s sake. It reinforces not just academics generally but one of the day’s

learning objectives. It’s upbeat but often short, sweet, and on point. And once it’s done, it’s done.

Vegas can be the thirty-second interlude when students do the “action verb shimmy,” sing the “long division song,” or compete to see who can do the best

charade for the day’s vocabulary word. It’s the moment when students compete to be the common denominator champion of the ﬁfth grade or to ﬁnish as the king

of Geography Mountain. It’s a commercial break to remind you of the names of all of the midwestern states. It’s the theatrical presentation of the story you

just read, discussed in hushed tones or excited chatter or, best, a combination Teach Like a Champion

of the two. Vegas moments have to be developed and implemented with care. Otherwise they can take students off task and do as much harm as good. Here

are a couple of sound design principles: • Production values. Performers vary their tone and pace, occasionally

whispering for emphasis, later speaking in a booming voice, sometimes speaking very slowly, sometimes racing along. Mike Taubman of North Star Academy uses

this when he reads and discusses a story with his students. During a discussion of the Pied Piper fable, for example, he asked students to infer the **lesson**. In

Taubman’s hands, the drama of the story was clearly evident, even in his summary of the ending, which he used to **help** his class reﬂect on the **lesson**. His pace

was quick and his voice loud, and he glossed the last moments of the tale: “He takes the children and hides them in a dark cave.” As Taubman neared the

end, he slowed down and dropped his voice, delivering the last word, forever, in a slow, emphatic stage whisper that broke the single word into two: “for

ever.” As he completed his dramatic summary, a moment of hushed silence ensued, and then almost every hand shot up into the air to explain the **lesson**.

The simple production values he added to the retelling successfully drew his students in.

• Like a faucet. David Berkeley of Boston Preparatory Charter ****School**** jazzed up his study of direct objects by letting students literally “ooh” and “ahh”

whenever one was mentioned. In setting up this moment of Vegas, Berkeley instructed his students, “It has to be like a faucet. You turn it on, then you turn

it off. And when I say it’s off, it’s off.” Discussing the sentence, “Mom put the baby in the crib,” Berkeley’s Vegas

might look like this: Berkeley:

Here is our verb, put, and at the end comes a phrase, in the crib. What **kind** of phrase is it, Charles?

Charles: It’s a prepositional phrase.

Berkeley: And between the two, Shayna? What’s that?

Shayna: It’s a direct object.

Class: Oooh. Aaaah.

Berkeley: That’s right, Shayna, a fabulous, brand-new direct object!

Class: Oooh. Aaah.

Engaging Students in Your Lessons 143 Berkeley:

And Steven Jones, tell Shayna what her direct object [pause here for oohs and ahhs] can receive!

Steven: It can receive the action or result of the verb.

Berkeley: [Making a faucet motion to signal that the ooh-ing and ahh-ing is

done] Perfect. What action gets done to or received by the baby in this sentence, Letty?

The ﬁnal piece is critical. It’s engaging to play the game, but if the game went on, it would distract students from the work of class and interfere with

Berkeley’s ability to teach because he’d get interrupted every time he said “direct object.” He needs to start a fun game he can control, not give birth to a monster

that takes on a life of its own. He may come back to it off and on through the **lesson** but cannot lose control of it. Good Vegas starts, is fun, and then is

done; it doesn’t keep cropping up when your back is turned, and it doesn’t start singing when it hasn’t been asked to. When that happens, you have to crack down

quickly. • Same objective. Vegas always has a speciﬁc learning objective and should

have the same objective as the **lesson** or, at its most daring, review previously mastered but related **content**. Berkeley chose his Vegas to add some game-show-

like shtick to his study of direct objects, but its object was to **help** his students focus on and recognize when direct objects appeared in sentences. It supported

rather than distracted from his purpose. • Chorus line. In Vegas, everyone in the show is singing the same tune

and doing the same steps at exactly the same time. In classrooms, everyone has to know the rules. If it’s a song, everyone has to know the words and the steps.

If it’s a multiplication showdown, students have to know when to stand, how to play, what to do if they lose, and so on, and everyone has to follow those rules.

If you allow students to sing any song they want or make up a cheer on the spot, you are asking for trouble.

• On point. In any group activity, participants can subtly express their disdain for the activity and its leader by participating corrosively: singing off-

key, or too loud, or overdoing the dance, or testing a lewd gesture. Good Vegas has to be vigilantly managed so that as soon as it is off-point, it is immediately

corrected and standards of excellence are reinforced. For tips on how to do that, you’ll want to read up on behavior management techniques like What to Do

(technique 37), Do It Again (technique 39), Positive Framing (technique 43), 100 Percent (technique 36), and Strong Voice (technique 38).

# Reflection and practice

1.

Many of the teachers I work with think that of all the techniques in this book, Cold Call is the one with the greatest and fastest capacity

to shift the culture of your classroom. Why do you think they feel so strongly about it?

2. Take a **lesson** plan for a class you’re getting ready to teach, and

mark it up by identifying three places where it would be beneﬁcial to use Cold Call. Script your questions, and write them into your

**lesson** plan. Make some notes about which students you’ll cold call. 3.

Take that same **lesson** plan, and mark it up to add two short sessions of Call and ****Response****. Again, script your questions. Try to

ask questions at all ﬁve levels, and note the in-cue you’ll use. 4.

Mark up your **lesson** one more time, this time identifying a place where all of your students will write answers to your question

before discussion. Be sure to consider where they will write and what the expectations will be. (Will you collect their work? Are

complete sentences required?) 5.

Make a short list of what you want your students to do or think about when you use Wait Time. Write yourself two or three

ﬁve-second scripts that you can practice and use while teaching to reinforce effective academic behaviors and discipline yourself

to wait. .

# Chapter five

# Creating a strong ****Classroom**** culture

The techniques in Chapter Five (as well as those in Chapters Six and Seven) focus

on building classroom culture—making your room, a place where students work hard, behave, model strong character, and do their best. Before I describe the spe-

ciﬁc methods champion teachers use to build strong classroom culture, it’s worth taking a few pages to understand it and the factors that drive it more deeply because

it’s more complex than it ﬁrst appears and because the techniques you’ll read about will make more sense when studied in the context of a bit more clarity about what

culture consists of.

# The five principles of classroom culture

Building a classroom culture that sustains and drives excellence requires master-

ing skills in ﬁve aspects of your relationships with students. These ﬁve aspects, or principles, are often confused and conﬂated. Many educators fail to consider the

difference between them; others use the names indiscriminately or interchange- ably. However, since you must be sure to make the most of all ﬁve in your

classroom, it’s worth taking a moment to distinguish them. Teach Like a Champion

# The five principles of classroom culture

Discipline

Management Control

Inﬂuence ****Engagement****

. Discipline

When most people use the word discipline, they refer to the process of admin- istering consequences and punishments. It’s a verb: “I discipline you.” I prefer

to use it as Ronald Morish does it in his excellent book, With All Due Respect: as a noun that refers to the process of teaching someone the right way to do

something or to the state of being able to do something the right way: “I have discipline” or “I teach discipline.” This sense of the word is also captured in

the meaning of self-discipline: the ability to make oneself do things all the way through and in the form of the word that refers to a body of ideas or method

of thinking (as an academic discipline). This reminds us that at the core of this deﬁnition of discipline is teaching—teaching students the right and successful

way to do things. Too often teachers have not

taken the time to teach their students, step by step, what

successful learning behavior looks like.

Ironically many

teachers forget

this element, even though it’s most closely aligned to how they deﬁne their

job. They expect to teach the **content** but

not necessarily

the habits

and processes of being a successful student

and community member. They set up systems of reward and consequence to

hold students accountable. They exhort students to do their best, assuming all the while that they know how to do what’s

best. But all too often teachers have not taken the time to teach their students, step by step, what successful learning behavior looks like, assuming instead

that students have inferred it in previous classrooms or doubting the value of having a right way to do things, like sitting in class, taking notes, and following

directions. As my colleague Doug McCurry says, “If they’re not doing what you asked, the most likely explanation is that you haven’t taught them.”

Creating a Strong ****Classroom**** Culture 147 ****Teaching**** with discipline implies a front-end investment in teaching your

charges how to be students, and that requires a fair amount of planning. How will your students sit, line up, enter the classroom, and take notes? It also

means investing in a whole lot of practice and deciding implicitly how good is good enough to meet standards as part of planning your discipline. The results

of emphasizing and investing in this deﬁnition of discipline can be stunning, however, because it turns out that there are a lot of kids on the margins of

classroom culture who want to do what’s expected of them. They are just waiting to be taught.

Management Management, by contrast, is the process of reinforcing behavior by consequences

and rewards. What we typically call “disciplining” is often really management: giving consequences. Some teachers see this as the whole game, and with what

at ﬁrst may appear to be signiﬁcant justiﬁcation. Effective classrooms need man- agement systems. But because management is the element of school culture that

has the most visible short-term results, it’s easy to fail to recognize its particu- lar reliance on the other four elements and its limitations without them. While

it makes operating an achievement-focused classroom more direct and efﬁcient and while this added efﬁciency and clarity is critical, management cannot sustain

itself without the other four elements of positive culture. Without them, man- agement, even in the best systems, ultimately suffers from diminishing marginal

returns: the more you use it, the less effective it is. When schools or teachers over-rely on management, a death spiral ensues:

students become desensitized to consequences and Machiavellian about rewards; more of each is required to achieve the same or lesser effect; students become

increasingly insensitive to the larger doses, and the larger doses signal to students either the desperation of their teacher or that they are problem kids, not successful

kids, and the currency of management becomes less rational and more negative. Strong management is not only a positive part of an effective classroom cul-

ture, but a necessary part, but effective management must operate in combination with the other four elements, or it will soon become ineffective management.

Teach students how to do things right, not just establish consequences for doing them wrong. To truly succeed you must be able to control students, that is, get

them to do things regardless of consequence, and to inspire and engage them in positive work. You also are building relationships with students that are non-

transactional; they don’t involve rewards or consequences, and they demonstrate that you care enough to know your students as individuals. And you recognize

that they are excellent classroom managers in part because of these skills. Teach Like a Champion

Control Control is your capacity to cause someone to choose to do what you ask, regard-

less of consequences. It’s a dirty word to many people. There has to be something wrong with controlling someone else. It’s undemocratic, they think, and coer-

cive. The intention to control another person seems especially reprehensible in a teacher, they say, because teaching is to **help** people think for themselves. How-

ever, a bit of context should make it clear that all of us exert control over other people’s actions and that we do it because it’s the right thing to do, especially

for teachers. In many cases, benign, enlightened control is a very good thing: a teacher reliably gets students to ask why and how questions when reading his-

tory, gets them to be suspicions of claims not supported by evidence, and reliably gets students to work hard, value learning, and respect their peers.

In fact, my deﬁnition of control is “the capacity to cause someone to choose to do what you ask, regardless of consequences.” It does not imply a lack of

subjectivity in the people you cause to do what you ask. They still choose. Controlling merely involves asking in a way that makes them more likely to agree

to do it. If you’ve done any reading in the emerging ﬁeld of behavioral economics, for example, Cass Sunstein and Richard Thaler’s popular and fascinating Nudge,

you’ll recognize that no choices are entirely neutral. Looking someone in the eye and speaking ﬁrmly is clearly exerting control. Meekly looking down and using

a pleading tone of voice is not. But there is no way to ask that does not fall somewhere on the spectrum between the two. It’s important to note that the way

I use control in this chapter is limited to a narrow range of social and behavioral interactions in the classroom, for example, sitting down when asked to.

Teachers who have strong control succeed because they

understand the power of language and relationships:

they ask respectfully, ﬁrmly, and conﬁdently but also with

civility, and often kindly. They express their faith in students.

The biggest paradox about control is that it is more than a necessary evil.

It often supports freedom. I know this as a parent. I can give my children the

freedom to run ahead of me on a side- walk and explore on their own only if I

have successfully taught them the rules for crossing the street (that is, if I have

“disciplined” them to know how to stop at the curb). But I also must know for

certain that if they neared a driveway with a car unexpectedly backing out and

I called to them to stop, they would, instantly and without fail. In addition to my other tools, I must also have control or I cannot be effective as a parent, either

Creating a Strong ****Classroom**** Culture 149 in protecting my children or in affording them opportunities to grow. The more

I have the power to exercise responsible control, the more freedom I can give my children, ideally in ways that truly matter.

Teachers who have strong control succeed because they understand the power of language and relationships: they ask respectfully, ﬁrmly, and conﬁdently but

also with civility, and often kindly. They express their faith in students. They replace vague and judgmental commands like “calm down” with speciﬁc and

useful ones like, “Please return to your seat and begin writing in your journal.” These actions evince clarity, purposefulness, resolve, and caring. If you can get

students to do what you are delegated with helping them to achieve, you are doing your job, and you’ve also saved your consequences for when you need

them most. So getting comfortable with the obligation to exert control is part of preparation for success.

Inﬂuence Ideally all teachers connect to their students and inspire them to want for them-

selves the things the class is trying to achieve. Inspiring students to believe, want to succeed, and want to work for it for intrinsic reasons is inﬂuencing

them. It’s the next step beyond control. Control gets them to do things you sug- gest; inﬂuence gets them to want to internalize the things you suggest. Although

less visible than getting kids to behave, getting them to believe—to want to behave positively—is the biggest driver of achievement and success because it

happens when kids want it for themselves and when it is real. It happens without you there, without your managing it. Belief, as the history of every powerful

idea from democracy to faith demonstrates, is a powerful and lasting motiva- tor. If inﬂuence is the process of instilling belief, maximizing it should be an

intentional goal of every teacher’s classroom culture. ****Engagement****

Champion teachers give students plenty to say yes to, plenty to get involved in, plenty to lose themselves in. They get students busily engaged in productive,

positive work. This gives them little time to think about how to act counterpro- ductively and lots that seems important and interesting to focus their energy on.

No matter what they may be thinking, what they’re doing is positive. This can have a powerful ancillary effect. One of Karl Marx’s more obscure but

insightful ideas is the base-superstructure theory: that people’s beliefs and values (the “superstructure” of a society) are a product of the “base” (the everyday

realities of their life). What you do all day shapes what you believe rather than Teach Like a Champion

vice versa. This can apply to your students’ daily role in school. Are they owners? Drudges? Serfs? Craftspeople? Happy entrepreneurs? The apparently mundane

daily interactions they have shape what they believe about and value in their school lives more than the other way around. People act (or are compelled to

act) a certain way and then explain their actions using ideology. ‘‘Sometimes you gotta change

from the outside in!’’ Other social critics have made this

same point, though more succinctly. For example, the 1990 ﬁlm My Blue Heaven,

in which an ex-maﬁoso (Steve Martin) teaches a straitlaced cop supervising him

in the federal witness protection program (Rick Moranis) to ﬁnd pleasure and verve in daily life. As Martin ushers Moranis into the changing room to try on a

slick suit he’s convinced him to buy, he advises through the dressing room door: “Sometimes you gotta change from the outside in!”

Kids too often change from the outside in. They see themselves being enthu- siastic and start to feel enthusiastic. They see themselves lost in their work and

start to think they are productive, contributing members of society and begin to believe and act accordingly more frequently. Champion teachers keep their

students positively engaged not just so that they are too busy to see opportunities to be off task but because after a while, they start to think of themselves as

positively engaged people. This is why engagement matters. The Synergy of the Five Principles

The techniques described in the following chapters rely on all ﬁve of these aspects of classroom culture to varying degrees. Some require more of one than another,

but because the synergy of the ﬁve makes each one stronger, the techniques an effective teacher uses ideally leverage all ﬁve. A teacher who uses only one or two

will ultimately fail to build a vibrant classroom culture. A teacher who uses only control but not discipline, for example, will produce students who never learn to

do things on their own and always need ﬁrm directives to act. A classroom in which the teacher does not have control and tries to address students who “don’t”

exclusively through management of consequences will overuse the consequences, accustom students to the consequences, and erode their effectiveness in his own

and other classes. A teacher who engages and inﬂuences without control and management will build a vibrant but inefﬁcient culture that allows some students

to opt out of learning, and a teacher who does these without teaching discipline will not adequately prepare students to succeed once they leave the microcosm of

Creating a Strong ****Classroom**** Culture 151 their classroom because they will not have had sufﬁcient practice in or knowledge

of how to sustain successful habits of scholarship. While the techniques in this book make varying use of one or several of

these principles (for example, technique 38, Strong Voice, is heavily focused on Control while technique 44, Precise Praise, is mostly about inﬂuence), the rest

of this chapter focuses almost exclusively on Discipline and on the Systems and Routines that are the hidden foundation of any classroom culture.

# Technique 28

# Entry routine

The ﬁrst routine that affects classroom culture is the one for how students enter.

Like all others, this is a routine whether you realize it (and shape it intentionally) or not. Unlike Threshold (technique 41 in Chapter Six), which immediately

precedes students’ entry into the room and focuses on setting behavioral norms and expectations, Entry Routine is about making a habit out of what’s efﬁcient,

productive, and scholarly after the greeting and as students take their seats and class begins.

A typical routine begins with students entering the room and picking up a packet of materials from a small table just inside the door. In some cases,

especially at the lower elementary grades, packets might already be at students’ desks. A couple of key points maximize the effectiveness of this part of the entry

routine. •

It’s far more efﬁcient to have students pick up their packets from a table than it is for you to try to hand the packets to them at the door. That only slows

you down and forces you to multitask when your mind should be on setting behavioral expectations and building relationships. It’s also far more efﬁcient

to have students pick up their packets from a table than it is for you to try to hand them out to them later while they sit and wait for them.

• Students should know where to sit. Milling around looking for a seat or

deciding where to sit or talking about deciding where to sit (“Can I sit next to him? Will he think I’m ﬂirting?”) are all examples of wasted time and energy.

Assign seats, or allow students to sign up for regular seats. Teach Like a Champion

• Whatever students need to do with homework (put it in a basket, place it on

the front left corner of their desk, pass it to a proctor), they should do the same way every day without prompting.

• A Do Now (the following technique) should be in the same place every day:

on the board or in the packet. The objectives for the **lesson**, the agenda, and the homework for the coming evening should be on the board already, also

in the same predictable place every day.

# Technique 29

# Do now

Students should never have to ask themselves, “What am I supposed to be

doing?” when they enter your classroom, nor should they be able to claim not to know what they should be doing. You want students to know what to do

and to know there is no ambiguity here. Those two goals—being clear with students about what to be working on and eliminating the excuses that lead to

distraction—are the rationale for Do Now, a short activity that you have written on the board or is waiting at their desks before they enter.

The Do Now means that students are hard at work even before you have fully entered the room. They are both productive during every minute and ready

for **instruction** as soon as you start. They have done the anticipatory set and are thinking about what’s coming.

An effective Do Now, which can bring incredible learning power to a room, should conform to four critical criteria to ensure that it remains focused, efﬁcient,

and effective: 1.

Students should be able to complete the Do Now without any direction from the teacher and without any discussion with their classmates. Some teachers

misunderstand the purpose of the Do Now and use a version of the tech- nique that requires them to explain to their students what to do and how

to do it: “Okay, class, you can see that the Do Now this morning asks you to solve some typical problems using area. Remember that to solve area

problems, you have to multiply.” This defeats the purpose of establishing a self-managed habit of productive work.

2. The activity should take three to ﬁve minutes to complete.

Creating a Strong ****Classroom**** Culture 153 3.

The activity should require putting a pencil to paper, that is, there should be a written product from it. This not only makes it more rigorous and more

engaging, but it allows you to better hold students accountable for doing it since you can clearly see whether they are (and they can see that you

can see). 4.

The activity should preview the day’s **lesson** (you are reading The Jacket, and the Do Now asks students to write three sentences about what they’d do

if they thought someone stole their little brother’s favorite jacket) or review a recent **lesson** (you want your kids to practice all of the standards they’ve

mastered recently so they don’t forget them). Beyond that, a Do Now works because of consistency and preparation. If

there isn’t a Do Now in the same place every single day, students can claim plausible deniability. That said, a Do Now doesn’t need to be written on the

board. If you do post it on the board, you can write it in advance on a large piece of newsprint and tape or use a magnet to afﬁx it to the board before

students walk in, thus saving precious moments when you would otherwise be transcribing the Do Now onto the board.

For example, a ﬁfth-grade English teacher might use a Do Now to review a vocabulary word from the previous week. Because the important thing is for

students to be able to do the work on their own, she would have already set the precedent that students could and should use their notes as necessary:

In your notebook: 1.

Deﬁne scarce. 2.

Explain how it means more than just having a small amount of something. 3.

Use scarce in a sentence that tells about a time when something being scarce affected you or your family.

4. Name the noun form of scarce.

This example is from a math class: 1.

Solve to ﬁnd the width of a rectangle with an area of 104 square centime- ters and a length of 13 centimeters. Show your work.

2. Give the possible dimensions of at least two other rectangles with the same

area but different dimensions. Teach Like a Champion

# Technique 30

# Tight transitions

# Transitions for students

Having quick and routine transitions that students can execute without extensive

narration by the teacher—that is, Tight Transitions—is a critical piece of any highly effective classroom. By transitions, I mean times when students move from

place to place or activity to activity, for example, when they line up for lunch. Your students spend a lot of time in transition—by necessity—and when they’re in tran-

sition, they are not learning. The transitions in high school (putting materials away before a test, say) look different from the transitions in elementary school (moving

to the carpet from desks, say). Still they occur at all levels of school and have an immense if generally underacknowledged inﬂuence on the learning that happens

before and after. If you were able to cut a minute apiece from ten transitions a day and sustained that improvement for two hundred school days, you would have cre-

ated almost thirty-ﬁve hours of instructional time over the school year. Practically speaking you would have added a week to your school year.

Messy transitions are also an invitation to disruptions and

conﬂicts that continue to undercut the classroom

**environment** even after class has started.

You can read all day long and well into the night about the need for more

resources in public education but every teacher has, at his or her ﬁngertips,

an opportunity to increase the scarcest and most important resource that money

buys by a signiﬁcant amount. Further- more, the time that’s wasted in poor

transitions often winds up being espe- cially critical. It’s often the difference

between getting through an exciting **lesson** and running out of time—an out- come that means failing to complete critical summative activities like recapping

and reviewing the **lesson** or introducing homework. Losing the last three minutes of a **lesson** undercuts the whole **lesson**. Messy transitions are also an invitation

to disruptions and conﬂicts that continue to undercut the classroom **environment** even after class has started. In short, the price of poor transitions is high, and

since only consistently effective procedures ensure smooth and speedy transitions, teachers should seek to practice doing it the same way every time until students

can follow through as a matter of habit. Creating a Strong ****Classroom**** Culture 155

By the end of the ﬁrst week of school, every student should know and understand procedures like how to line up and move from place to place with-

out having to be told. In an effective classroom, transitions take less than thirty seconds, and often far less. To engineer effective transitions in your classroom,

start by mapping the route. There is one right way to line up, one path each student follows on the way to the reading area, the door, or some other place.

Your students should follow the same path every time. Then they need to prac- tice under your watchful eye, often multiple times a day. You instincts will tell

you that you are wasting time, but the opposite is true. Look at it as mak- ing an investment. Save hours and hours over the course of the year by investing

an extra ﬁve or ten minutes for the ﬁrst few days of school. When you teach students to transition effectively, scaffold the steps in the

transition. That is, teach them to follow their route one step at a time. One especially effective way to do this is to number your steps. You might announce

to a class of third graders: “When I say one, please stand and push in your chairs. When I say two, please turn to face the door. When I say three, please follow

your line leader to the place to line up.” Once you’ve done that, you merely have to call the number for the appropriate step. But in calling the number (or

not calling it), you can control the pace of the transition, slowing it down as necessary to ensure success and accountability, speeding it up as students are

ready, and ultimately dispensing with the numbers and merely saying, “When I say go, please line up,” and observing as your students follow the steps. You

should expect such a process to take several weeks to instill completely. Another effective way to teach transitions is to use a method called point-to

point movement or, when transitions cause you to move around the building, point-to-point walking. You identify a location or an action, and students move

to that point and stop, as in, “Please walk to the end of the hallway and stop there, Jason.” The key is that as you instruct students to complete a step in the

transition, you set not only a beginning but a stopping point in advance so that the activity never gets out of your control. You know students will walk only

to the end of the hall. If they aren’t quiet enough, you can call them back right away rather than watch them wend around the corner and out of sight, barely

within your inﬂuence, never mind control. With point-to-point and other scaffolding methods, your goals are both speed

and orderliness. You need to get your students to be fast. This is an area that many teachers forget when the success of control goes to their heads. They

ratchet down on every step and accept slow and orderly transitions because they make them feel as if they are in control. Both to challenge your students

Teach Like a Champion and set goals for them and also to discipline yourself to focus on speed, practice

transitions against the clock, preferably with a stopwatch, forever trying to get your students to be a little faster. “We did this in sixteen seconds yesterday; let’s

shoot for twelve today!” Also control what your students say during transitions. If your transitions are

quick enough, there’s no reason they can’t be silent, thereby avoiding distractions from students arguing and squabbling and focusing them on the transition more

clearly. As an alternative, you might do as Sultana Noormuhammad does at Lead-

ership Preparatory Charter ****School**** and have your students sing their transitions. One morning they stood behind their desks as a student led them through their

ﬁght song, an adapted version of the ﬁght song of their namesake, Indiana Uni- versity, in which students sing about their willingness to do homework and work

hard. Before the song ends, they’re marching to the reading area, in perfect rows unwinding counterclockwise around their table groups and singing at the top of

their lungs as they take their place in line. Their song ends as they sit on the carpet, ending the transition free of distraction, right on cue and with the mood

high. Five seconds later, teaching has begun. And although Noormuhammad’s students are kindergartners, if you think older kids can’t sing their transition think

again, this time of the armed forces, where soldiers routinely sing songs as they move from place to place for much the same purpose: to keep their mood up,

focus them on the task, and avoid distractions. Finally, you’ll need consistent enforcement. When your students start testing

to see if they really have to follow the rules of the road, they should always ﬁnd that they do. Do It Again (technique 39 in Chapter Six) is especially effective in

helping students practice doing transitions correctly since you are always right in the middle of something you can try over again and since transitions are the

ideal time for group responsibility.

# Moving materials

The necessity (and most of the rules) for efﬁcient transitions applies just as

much when materials rather than people are moving from place to place. Invest at the outset in teaching one right way to do it. Work with a stopwatch, and

practice over and over. Gain time for **instruction** by making these times in your day speedy and seamless. For passing and collecting papers, books, and other

materials to and from students, there are a couple of additional rules of thumb: •

Generally pass across rows, not up and back. This avoids the need for turning around 180 degrees in chairs, an action that creates a golden opportunity for

Creating a Strong ****Classroom**** Culture 157 hard-to-see, hard-to-manage face-to-face interactions in which one person

always has his or her back to you. •

Distribute materials in groups: to the student at the end of each row, to each table.

In clip 13 on the DVD, Doug McCurry models Tight Transitions. I discuss this

clip in the Introduction to the book as well because of the incredible return on Doug’s invested time in teaching his students to pass out papers. What’s

equally powerful about the clip is the students’ response. Far from being annoyed and frustrated by being asked to pass papers back and forth to

achieve a faster time, they love the challenge and are literally on the edge of their seats. Much of the key to accomplishing this alchemy is Doug’s

Positive Framing (technique 43 in Chapter Seven), speciﬁcally his constant use of challenge.

# Binder control

Care enough about and

demonstrate the importance of what you teach to build a

system for the storage, organization, and recall of

what your students have learned.

Certain freedoms are overrated: the free- dom to lose papers, for example, or

the freedom to take notes on a grubby, torn half-sheet of paper that ultimately

becomes buried at the bottom of a backpack.

Care enough

about and

demonstrate the importance of what you teach to build a system for the storage,

organization, and recall of what your stu- dents have learned. The technique for

this is Binder Control. Have a required place for them to take notes; have that

Teach Like a Champion place be in a required binder, which is ideally provided by you and which you

may even require to remain in the classroom at night so it won’t get lost, dam- aged, or disorganized on the way to and from school. Your students can take

home what they need that night in a homework folder, which can be color-coded so you and parents can readily identify it. Each night students can put everything

they need for that night’s assignment in the folder and leave the binder in the classroom.

Have a required format for organizing papers within the binder so everybody is using the same system and you can check to make sure everyone has and can

ﬁnd what they need. You might, for example, assign a number to all materials you expect students to keep in the binders and have students enter them into

a table—for example, 37: notes on subject-verb agreement; 38: subject-verb agreement worksheet; 39: subject-verb agreement homework; and 40: worksheet

for subject-verb agreement with compound subject. That way when you say, “If you don’t remember, check your notes,” you

know every student has the notes, and you can even tell them where in their binders they can ﬁnd them. “They should be at number 37.” Finally, you can

ensure that students have a full and complete packet when reviewing for tests: “You’ll need to take home items 32 to 45 from your binder to prepare for

this test.” To ensure that students follow through, take the time to have students put

their materials away during class: “Please add number 37, notes on subject-verb agreement, to your table of contents, and ﬁle these notes away on my signal. I

want to hear your binders popping open on three”

# Technique 32

# Slant

No matter how great the **lesson**, if students aren’t alert, sitting up, and actively

listening, teaching them is like pouring water into a leaky bucket. Many teachers and schools practice lining up for ﬁre drills and make sure everyone knows the

routine for ﬁnding the right bus at the end of the day, but they rarely think about how to teach the behaviors and skills that **help** students concentrate, focus, and

learn. Creating a Strong ****Classroom**** Culture 159

Five key behaviors that maximize students’ ability to pay **attention** are in the acronym SLANT (the acronym was originally used by the ﬁrst KIPP schools):

Sit up. Listen.

Ask and answer questions. Nod your head.

Track the speaker. Some schools use variations of the SLANT technique, for example, STAR (Sit

up, Track the speaker, Ask and answer questions like a scholar, and Respect those around you) or S-SLANT (which adds “smile”).

One of the best aspects of the acronym is that it serves as shorthand. Teachers remind students to be attentive and ready learners by urging them simply and

quickly to SLANT. The use of a consistent acronym is quick and efﬁcient. Even better, SLANT can be broken apart when necessary. Teachers can remind their

students about the “S” in SLANT or the “T” in it. In the best classrooms, the word is deeply embedded in the vocabulary of learning, as a noun (“Where’s my

SLANT?”) and a verb (“Make sure you are SLANTing”). Since SLANTing is such a critical part of a high-performing classroom, you

may want to develop nonverbal signals that allow you to reinforce and correct SLANTing without interrupting what you’re otherwise doing: hands folded in

front of you to remind students to sit up straight; pointing to your eyes with two ﬁngers to remind students to track.

# Technique 33

# On your mark

No coach in the world would let players enter the huddle without a helmet on or

catch a fastball without a glove. You can’t hope to win if you’re not standing at the starting line with your shoes tied when the race begins. You should think the

same way about learning in your classroom: every student must start class with books and paper out and pen or pencil in hand. This must be the expectation in

Teach Like a Champion every class, every day. A coach doesn’t start practice by telling kids to get their

shoes on; kids show up with their shoes on. So don’t ask your students to get ready as class begins; use On Your Mark to show them how to prepare before

it begins and then expect them to do so every day. How to Ensure Students Are on Their Marks When Class Starts

1. Be explicit about what students need to have to start class. Make it a small

and ﬁnite list (fewer than ﬁve things) that doesn’t change: 

• Paper out 

• Desk clear (of everything unnecessary to the **lesson**) 

• Pencil sharp and ready (“in the pencil tray”) 

• Homework (in the upper right-hand corner of your desk) At North Star Academy in Newark, principal Jamey Verilli refers to students’

work stations, or just “stations,” which they set up as part of their entry rou- tine. On the wall is a diagram of how materials should look when a station

is set up: books upper left, homework upper right, blank paper in the center. And nothing else.

2. Set a time limit. Be speciﬁc about when students need to have the everything

ready. If you’re not clear about when students need to be ready, your efforts to hold those who aren’t accountable will result in arguments when students

say they “were doing it” or “were about to.” 

3. Use a standard consequence. 

Have a small and appropriate consequence that you can administer without hesitation—perhaps loss of some privilege or

doing some work to **help** the class stay prepared. Students who weren’t on their marks might lose points in a token economy, have to sharpen all of

the pencils in the pencil tray at lunchtime, or come to “homework club” ten minutes before school to make sure they have everything they need for the

coming day. 

4. Provide tools without consequence (pencils, paper) to those who recognize the need before class. 

There’s a difference between not having a pencil and

getting your pencil ready before class, only to realize the tip is broken or that you accidentally left it in math class. Part of preparation is recognizing in

advance that you need something. Give students the incentive to take respon- sibility for getting what they need by allowing them access to the tools for

them to succeed without consequence as long as they recognize this need Creating a Strong ****Classroom**** Culture 161

before you’ve started class. You might have a coffee can full of sharpened pencils that students can take if they trade in their old one and a stack of clean

looseleaf paper on the corner of your desk. Students could **help** themselves to these during Entry Routine. Once class starts, the consequence for not being

On Your Mark would apply.

5. Include homework. Homework is the most important thing most students will do all day that isn’t directly supervised by a teacher. It cannot be left

to chance. Make turning it in part of the routine students follow to be ready for the day. It should be turned in and checked for completeness at the start

of class. There should be a separate consequence of not doing it—usually coming to “homework club” after school or during gym to complete the work

that hasn’t been done.

# Technique 34

# Seat signals

The bathroom is the last bastion of the unconverted. Given the opportunity,

some students (especially those who can least afford it) will ﬁnd creative ways to maximize their time there, particularly during the time of day when they can

least afford it. For other students, a long, slow walk to the pencil sharpener can be an opportunity for unique displays of deportment not necessarily designed

to reinforce their classmates’ learning. An impressive degree of distraction can be created by enterprising students out of their seats at the wrong time or at their

own discretion. Furthermore, managing requests for bathroom and the like—justiﬁed or not,

approved or not—can become a distraction from teaching. Conversations about who’s next and when can eat up precious minutes. And you risk the scenario

in which, at the critical moment in your **lesson** that you ask some key question, a student with his hand eagerly in the air would like to go to the bathroom.

Your momentum and train of thought are shot. In short, you can’t afford not to develop a set of signals for common needs, especially those that require or allow

students to get out of their seats. You need Seat Signals. This system should meet the following criteria:

• Students must be able to signal their request from their seats.

• Students must be able to signal requests nonverbally.

Teach Like a Champion •

The signals should be speciﬁc and unambiguous but subtle enough to prevent them becoming a distraction.

• You should be able to manage both their requests and your response without

interrupting **instruction** (with a nod yes or no, for example, or ﬁve ﬁngers for “in ﬁve minutes”).

• You should be explicit and consistent about the signals you expect students to

use, posting them on the wall so students can see them and disciplining your- self to require them by responding only when they are used.

These signals, adopted from their use in top classrooms, tend to work: •

“Can I use the bathroom, please?” Hand up; two ﬁngers crossed. •

“I need a new pencil”: Hold pencil up, wait for exchange. Generally having presharpened pencils that students take or that you deliver to kids in exchange

for broken or dull pencils is a far better system than letting kids sharpen them; it’s quicker and less disruptive. If you’re sure you want to let them sharpen, try

hands together in ﬁsts, one rotating like a crank gesture for “I need to sharpen my pencil.”

• “I need a tissue”: Left hand pinching nose.

• “I need to get out of my seat” (to get something that dropped on the ﬂoor): One

ﬁnger held up rotated in a circular motion. It also makes sense to consider making clear rules about when students

can ask for certain freedoms that require seat signals. For example, you do not want to consider bathroom requests at critical parts of your **lesson**. Instead, allow

bathroom visits only at certain times during class, say, the last ﬁfteen minutes. Or you could tie the degree of freedom students have to your behavior management

system. For example, if you use colored cards (green, yellow, red) for each student to track his or her level of behavior, as many schools do, you might offer

anyone on green the right to ask for the bathroom anytime after the ﬁrst ﬁfteen minutes of class, while those on yellow can go only during the last ten minutes.

If you use a system that limits access to the bathroom, you’re ensuring that you’ll get “emergency” requests—some real, some not—so you must be

prepared for that. A good solution is to establish a separate bathroom emergency signal that students can use when bathroom visits are not approved. Students

would have to “buy” the right to go in such an emergency situation through Creating a Strong ****Classroom**** 

some reasonable compensation. You could allow students to purchase the right for some other price, for example, say, twenty math problems or ten minutes of

classroom service (cleaning desks, picking up trash).

# Technique 35

# Props

Effective systems and routines can also make your classroom more productive by

harnessing public praise. Props—also called “shout-outs” and “ups”—are public praise for students who demonstrate excellence or exemplify virtues. Everyone

responds to praise, to a crowd cheering for them and rooting them on. Making sure that it happens, inspires, and is reliably on-message is one of the most pro-

ductive things you can do in your classroom. What better reward is there for trying a tough question, persevering, ﬁnding your own mistake, or explaining

to your peers how to solve a problem than receiving the public praise of the class? If you can consistently enable classmates to deliver resounding praise to

their peers in two seconds ﬂat, you can build a culture that valorizes achieve- ment and effort without sacriﬁcing order or time on task. Your students hear the

command—“Two stomps for Imani!”—and respond automatically and thunder- ously: every foot stomping twice (and only twice) in unison before it’s back to

learning. The key is investing the time at the outset to teach students to give props the

right way: crisply, quickly, and enthusiastically. Ensuring that you teach your students to deliver Props that meet the following criteria will go a long way to

ensuring your success: 

• Quick. You should be able to cue a prop in one second. If you say, “Two claps for David” and the response is any slower than that, take the time to teach your

students to do it right by doing it again and doing it faster: “When we give up our claps, it’s because someone did something great, so I want to hear them

right away. Let’s give that one more time and see if we can do it in less than a second.” Similarly, the Prop itself should be fast because you don’t have

time to waste and because there’s nothing less energizing than an exhortation that starts strong but peters out. Be short so the energy level stays high. The

routine for Props should take less than ﬁve seconds from beginning to end. The transition back to the task at hand is immediate.

• Visceral. Teachers often assume a Prop has to be verbal and carry a message. To the contrary, Props are usually better when they rely on movement and

sound, especially percussive sound. Props that don’t use much in the way of words are less likely to get tiresome; their half-life is longer because there’s

no phrase to wear out. A quick, “Oh, yeah,” is ﬁne but something like, “On the way to college!” is likely to get old (and show its age) quickly. Furthermore,

there’s something fun and muscular about the thunder of group percussion. Students like noise and rhythm. Some will drum on anything in your class if

given the chance. Embrace that. Make sure your Props involve movement and controlled but emphatic noise such as the stomping of feet or clapping of

hands. 

•Universal. When you give Props, everybody joins in. It’s up to you to set and enforce this expectation.

• Enthusiastic. The tone is fun and lively. It should be a break—brief and

fun—from hard work. Resist the temptation to make it too grown-up; it doesn’t have to narrate values and express a mission-aligned personal credo.

If it is a little bit of silly, it will reinforce moments when students have already demonstrated those things. Props are the exclamation point, not the sentence.

Just make it fun enough for students to want to join in. One easy way to increase students’ enthusiasm is to let a student choose the Prop from among

the various ones you’ve developed as a class. 

• Evolving. Let your students suggest and develop ideas for Props. They will constantly renew the systems with fresh and funky ideas and will participate

more vigorously because they will have helped invent them. And if they are forever thinking of new ones, Props will never get tired, boring, and

obligatory. Here are six ideas for Props (most of them stolen from great teachers, who

themselves borrowed them or invented them with the **help** of students): 

• “The Hitter.” You say, “Let’s give Clarice a Hitter.” Your kids pretend to toss a ball and swing a bat at it. They shield their eyes as if to glimpse its distant

ﬂight. Then they mimic crowd noise suitable for a home run for some fraction of a full second.

• “The Lawnmower.” You say: “Let’s give Jason a Lawnmower.” Your kids

reach down to pull the chord to start the mower and yank upward twice. They make engine sounds, grip the imaginary handles, and smile for some fraction

of a full second before the Prop ends. Creating a Strong ****Classroom**** Culture

• “The Roller-Coaster.” You say: “Oh, man, that answer deserves a Roller-

coaster.” Your kids put their open hands in front of them pointing upward at forty-ﬁve degrees, palms down. They “chug, chug, chug” (three times only)

with their hands mimicking a roller coaster slugging its way up the last steep hill. Then they shout “Woo, woo, woo” three times as their hands mimic a

coaster speeding over three steep hills after the big drop. •

“Two Hands.” You say: “Jimmie, lead us in a No Hands.” Jimmie calls out, “Two hands!” Your kids snap twice with both hands while chanting, “Ay,

ay!” Jimmie calls out, “One hand!” Your kids snap twice with one hand while chanting “Ay, ay!” Jimmie calls out, “No hands!” Your kids do a funky

impromptu dance for exactly one second. 

• “Hot Pepper.” You say: “An answer like that deserves a Hot Pepper.” Your kids hold up an imaginary hot pepper, dangling it above their mouths. They

take a bite and make a sizzle sounds “tssssss” for exactly one second. •

“Two Snaps, Two Stomps.” You say: “Two snaps, two stomps for Jimmie P.!” or a variation on the sounds. Your kids deliver two snaps and two thundering

stomps that end perfectly on cue.

# Reflection and practice

1. Script the steps and expectations for the ﬁve most critical routines in your classroom.

2. Make a poster outlining everything your students need to have to

be prepared at the beginning of class. Post it on your wall. ****Practice**** referring students to it (nonverbally perhaps) before class begins.

3. Make a list of the three most common requests students make

while you are teaching. Determine an appropriate nonverbal signal they can give you to request each of them. Make a poster showing

each. ****Practice**** pointing at the poster and asking students to return to their seat if they do not ask for and receive your nonverbal

approval for one week. Do not always give them your approval if the request comes during key instructional time.

# Setting and Maintaining high Behavioral Expectations

This book began with a study of the techniques champion teachers use to raise

academic expectations and make classrooms places of rigorous and intentional learning. And, of course, that is and should be the goal of schooling. That said,

all of the techniques in the ﬁrst chapters of this book won’t serve you very well if you can’t establish high behavioral expectations. It’s one of the responsibilities of

the job to bring order and respect sufﬁcient to protect all students’ right to learn to your classroom. Even if you don’t want to be the **kind** of teacher who’s “strict,”

I hope you will recognize the non-negotiable aspects of a strong behavioral **environment** and also that the techniques in this chapter can be mastered by

anyone (some of the best practitioners I know are quiet and reserved in both nature and manner) and can be adapted in any of a thousand individual styles.

# Technique 36

# 100 percent

There’s one suitable percentage of students following a direction given in your

classroom: 100 Percent. If you don’t achieve this, you make your authority subject to interpretation, situation, and motivation. Students have cause to ask

Teach Like a Champion themselves: “Did she mean that? For everyone? Do I feel like going along with

her today?” The assertion that the standard, not the goal, is 100 percent compliance may

sound terrifying and draconian: a power-hungry plan for a battle of wills or the blueprint for an obedience-obsessed classroom where little but grinding disci-

pline is achieved. The classrooms of champion teachers belie this expectation, however. They ﬁnesse their way to the standard with a warm and positive tone.

They are crisp and orderly; students do as they’re asked without ever seeming to think about it. Yet the culture of compliance is both positive and, most impor-

tant, invisible. Not only can these two characteristics be part of a classroom with maximum order, but in the end, they must. Discipline that is most often posi-

tive and invisible (that is, a matter of habit) is, arguably, the only sustainable variety.

# Key idea

# 100 percent

There’s one acceptable percentage of students following a

direction: 100 percent. Less, and your authority is subject to interpretation, situation, and motivation.

While champion teachers regularly achieve 100 Percent in a crisp, decisive, and nearly invisible way, those who don’t are often unaware of which and how

many students do what they ask when they ask it. Many teachers who fail to approach the 100 percent standard stop noticing whether they are achieving full

compliance. Remedying this is the ﬁrst step to achieving the highest behavioral expectations: to wield power justly but ﬁrmly, you must be keenly aware of how

students respond to your directions. The ﬁrst step is to notice. One morning, a third-grade teacher wanted to address her class. She raised

her hand in the practiced signal for silence: students are expected to quietly raise their hands as well, and on the morning in question, about three-quarters of her

class did so, with the room becoming quiet enough for her to speak and be heard. Should she proceed?

Setting and Maintaining High Behavioral Expectations 169 Many teachers, maybe even most, would do so, but if they did, they would

overlook the quarter of their students who had failed to comply with an explicit direction. Some might argue, “They’re not in the way; move on,” but that lends

tacit approval to the noncompliance. Unless she wants to send the message that following an explicit direction is optional, she shouldn’t begin until all hands are

raised. There’s an important distinction to make here. If the teacher had only asked

for silence, it would be okay to proceed once the room was quiet, but the teacher asked students to do two things: be quiet and respond to her signal. Only some

students did that, so she should wait before proceeding, and use the methods in the 100 Percent technique to achieve full compliance, and as quickly and

positively as possible. However, before I discuss the how, it’s worth thinking about why. The dan-

ger of moving on without compliance risks allowing a toxic culture of “only the good kids do what they’re asked” to develop. It causes students to see non-

compliance as an option, to contemplate a choice between compliance with the teacher or the freedom of their untrammeled peers. It’s not much of a choice,

and in many classrooms, the culture of noncompliance spreads quickly to pre- viously supportive students. Furthermore, when a teacher makes minor requests

discretionary, getting everyone to oblige her when she needs it most will require her to risk either an authority-weakening bout of pleading or a pitched and pub-

lic showdown with some of her students—probably her toughest ones. She will have to reset unproductive expectations. This is a bad place to be, and many

teachers get there before they realize they’re on the way. I’ve chosen the example of a teacher with her hand raised for silence because

it is a commonly used—or, rather, misused—device and because it shows the ease with which teachers learn to ignore noncompliance.

The teacher in the example was asking for two different things—in fact, two things that are not necessarily related. Students have four possible actions in

response: raise their hands and not be silent, be silent and not raise their hands, raise their hands and become silent, or neither raise their hands nor become

silent. Including raising hands in the command means more variables and more outcomes to attend to. It may well be that raising hands helps achieve silent

attentiveness, but the teacher should at least ask: Is there a less invasive way to achieve silent attentiveness? Do I want to take the time right now to manage two

compliance variables fully? She might consider whether it would be more effec- tive to have students quietly sit up straight, with their eyes on her, to show they

are ready to listen rather than raise their hands. This would still give her students Teach Like a Champion

an **attention** routine and herself a visual way to check for compliance. However, the visual check of eye contact is subtler than raised hands and eliminates the

issue of marginal compliance. It can be done more quickly and is arguably better preparation for what life asks of attentive people: eye contact and alertness.

So there are a lot of reasons that being serious about students’ doing what you asked can cause you to reconsider what you ask for. Ideally the process

of reﬂecting will cause you to be more efﬁcient in classroom processes. But whatever you choose, you must take your own commands seriously. If you ask,

they should do it. The example raises a second point about compliance. If the correct percent-

age of follow-through is 100 percent, so is the correct extent of follow-through. Tolerating marginal compliance, especially when public, will also have a corro-

sive effect. When the teacher in the example starts to get hands in the air from her students, she will set expectations, again whether she recognizes it or not,

about what follow-through looks like and how much is enough. Students will be consciously or unconsciously asking themselves versions of the following

questions: •

“Is it okay to just raise my hand halfway?” •

“Can’t I rest my elbow on the desk?” •

“Is there some way to do this and not look like I am trying to be her pet?” •

“Is it okay to life my hand the minimum conceivable amount (say, with a slight articulation of the wrist) and demonstrate to my friends that I am only humor-

ing this teacher because I have graciously decided it is not worth my time to disrespect her publicly?”

The most sustainable form of compliance is one that for

both students and teachers is clearly an exercise that will

**help** students achieve, not an empty exercise in teacher

power. The answer to these should be no.

The message should be, “What we do, we do right because it helps us on the

path to college.” Excellence is the habit: what you do, you should do well, and the

easiest way to do it well is to do it well every time. If the teacher has set rais-

ing hands as the expectation, she should stand by it. This may again cause her to

reconsider whether this is the setting in which she wants to enforce what a hand

Setting and Maintaining High Behavioral Expectations 171 in the air should look like. Again, the more seriously you take compliance,

the more you should reﬂect on the justness and discretion of your commands. Ultimately the most sustainable form of compliance is one that for both stu-

dents and teachers is clearly an exercise that will **help** students achieve, not an empty exercise in teacher power. It happens that in most top classrooms,

there’s lots of learning how to do routines and rituals right. There needs to be a clear signal for quiet attentiveness, and the teacher needs to be able to see

it as well as hear it. But it also needs to stand the test of alignment with the end goal.

# See it in action: clip 14

# 100 percent and what to do

In clip 14 on the DVD, Ashley Buroff of Rochester Prep models 100 Percent

and What to Do (described later in this chapter). She starts with a simple and clear What to Do direction: ‘‘Track me.’’ She then takes a moment to,

in 100 Percent parlance, ‘‘be seen looking.’’ As she asks her students to lift their packets into the air to rip the last page off (and in so doing making

students’ compliance eminently visible to her), she again gives a series of concrete observable directions: ‘‘Go ahead and lift your packets up into

the air holding the Do Now in one hand and the rest of the packet in the other.’’ It’s hard to misunderstand that one. She caps with an anonymous

individual correction: ‘‘Still waiting on everybody.’’ As you can see (and so can the students), the compliance rate is a clear 100 percent.

# Principles of 100 percent compliance

Your goal is to get 100

percent compliance so you can teach. You want the

intervention to be fast and invisible.

Three principles are key to ensuring con- sistent follow-through and compliance

in the classroom. These principles are critical not just to ensuring 100 Percent

but to ensuring that a healthy classroom climate endures, that the pace of class

is crisp, and that academics remain the Teach Like a Champion

primary focus. The ﬁrst principle, using the least invasive intervention possible, serves as a rule of thumb for mastery of this technique.

Use the Least Invasive Form of Intervention Your goal is to get 100 percent compliance so you can teach. Getting this compli-

ance at the cost of constant, time-consuming disruptions to make sure everyone’s on task ironically serves to stop the progress of the task and cause the death spi-

ral: all the disruptions to keep people on task result in no task, and thus everyone inherently is off task. The students “on the bubble,” the ones you’ve fought hard-

est to engage, start to look around at what else is going on to engage in. Disaster. You want the intervention to be fast and invisible.

In the following potential interventions, the goal is to have a correction be as near to the top of the list as possible:

• Nonverbal intervention. Gesture to or eye contact with off-task students while doing something else, preferably teaching the others. By many measures,

teachers interrupt their own lessons more than students do, so using nonverbal correction while teaching keeps your **lesson** on rails.

• Positive group correction. Quick verbal reminder to the group about what students should be doing and not what they shouldn’t be doing: “We’re

following along in our books”; “You should be tracking the speaker.” It is used just as student **attention** appears on the brink of wandering.

• Anonymous individual correction. Quick verbal reminder to the group, similar to positive group correction, except that the anonymous individual cor-

rection makes it explicit that not everyone is where they need to be: “We need two people.” “Homeroom Morehouse, please check yourself to make sure you’ve

got your eyes on the speaker.” • Private individual correction. When and if you have to name names (you

will have to, especially when you are setting expectations early in the year), seek to correct privately and quietly. Walk by the off-task student’s desk. Lean down

conﬁdently to get as near to him as possible and, using a voice that preserves as much privacy as is possible, tell the corrected student what to do quickly and

calmly. Then talk about something else. Something like, “Quentin, I’ve asked everyone to track me, and I need to see you doing it too,” will sufﬁce on the ﬁrst

**interaction**. If you need to return, it’s time for a consequence. Again you want to do this privately: “Quentin, I need you to track me so you can learn. I’m going

to have to [move your card to yellow, take two scholar dollars, ask you to come in and practice at recess]. Now please show me your best.”

In clip 15 on the DVD, Jaimie Brillante of Rochester Prep is demonstrating

the private individual correction. Notice how she makes her intervention an exercise in purpose, not in power: the reason she’s talking to her student

is that she wasn’t able to answer correctly. The goal is for her to succeed academically, not pay **attention** to Brillante or to do what Brillante asked.

Notice how she focuses other students on a clear task before addressing. She even gets tissues for another student to make her approach less

obvious and thus the **interaction** more private. Finally, notice the calm, ﬁrm, nonjudgmental tone. Brillante is careful to tell her students how to

solve the problem. Want to know more? Check out the interview with Jaimie Brillante in

the Appendix of this book. • Lightning-quick public correction. You will be forced at times to make

corrections of individual students during public moments. Your goals in making an individual verbal correction should be to limit the amount of time a student

is “onstage” for something negative and focus on telling the student what to do right rather than scolding or explicating what he did wrong (when possible) to

normalize the positive behavior of the majority of the class by pointing that out too. Something like, “Quentin, I need your eyes,” is quick, conﬁdent, and effec-

tive. Your correction might add, “Quentin, I need your eyes. Looking sharp, back row!” In rare cases you may wish to emphasize your attentiveness to Quentin’s

accountability (to Quentin and his classmates) by adapting the sequence as fol- lows: “Quentin, I need your eyes. Looking sharp, back row! Thank you, Quentin.

Much better.” When the interactions follow a sequence, the narration of them should gen-

erally gather positive momentum. They end on the positive (“much better”) and allow you to describe to your class the progress toward excellence (Quentin was

off task, but now he’s on). Although you are making a correction, your narration emphasizes that things are getting better.

Notice the importance of speed. I recommend using the longest of the above sequences only occasionally and avoiding anything longer if possible.

Teach Like a Champion Finally, notice the practical utility of the correction. Merely saying Quentin’s

name, as many teachers might do, doesn’t provide Quentin with any guidance about how to meet your expectations. This is a critical point, discussed further

in What to Do. • Consequence. The ideal is to solve a case of noncompliance quickly,

successfully, and with the least possible disruption to the whole class. In the long run, it makes a teacher stronger when he or she only occasionally uses

external consequences. Solving issues without external consequences reinforces the teacher’s intrinsic power. However, if a situation cannot be addressed quickly

and successfully without a consequence, the consequence must be given so that **instruction** is not interrupted. As with other interventions, consequences should

be delivered quickly and in the least invasive, least emotional manner. Ideally a teacher has a scaled series of consequences from which to choose, so she can

match the signiﬁcance of the response to the disruption and, in so doing, ensure her own ability to administer it quickly, decisively, and without wavering. This

is discussed further in No Warnings (technique 42, later in this chapter).

In clip 16 on the DVD, Bob Zimmerli of Rochester Prep demonstrates 100

Percent. Notice in particular his: •

Positive group corrections: ‘‘Everybody.’’ ‘‘All hands down; show me SLANT now!’’

• Anonymous individual correction: ‘‘I still need three people. You know

who you are. I need two people.’’ •

Lightning quick public correction: ‘‘I don’t have Marissa, but I do have Jasmine!’’

Zimmerli’s students are ‘‘rolling their numbers.’’ That is, they are learning to do repeated addition with a given number so they can learn

and check their multiplication tables. Notice how the use of ﬁngers in number rolling allows Zimmerli to more readily see who’s participating.

He’s made compliance visible. You could argue he’s doing something similar Setting and Maintaining High Behavioral Expectations 175

when he asks his students to ‘‘track [look at] this paper,’’ and then moves across the front of the room. If he sees their heads swivel, he knows they’re

paying **attention**, yet another way to make compliance visible. Want to know more? Check out the interview with Bob Zimmerli in

the Appendix to this book. One common misperception about the six levels of intervention is the belief

that they represent a process or a formula: that teachers always progress method- ically through each of the levels, trying all ﬁve types of correction in sequence

before giving a consequence. Nothing could be further from the reality. The goal is to be as close to the top of the list as possible and when possible, but

your ﬁdelity should be to what works, not to the list. Sometimes go straight to the ﬁfth level, sometimes go back and forth among the levels, and occa-

sionally allow ﬁve interventions to an off-task individual before assigning a consequence. In fact, using levels 1 to 5 implies that the students to whom the

interventions are directed are making (or appear likely to be making) a good- faith effort to comply with expectations. ****Behavior**** that is deliberate has earned a

consequence. Ignoring misbehavior is the

most invasive form of intervention because it

becomes more likely that the behavior will persist and

expand. Another common misperception is

that ignoring misbehavior—or address- ing it by praising students who are

behaving—is the least invasive form of intervention. But ignoring misbehavior

is the most invasive form of interven- tion because it becomes more likely that

the behavior will persist and expand. The goal is to address behavior quickly—the

ﬁrst time it appears and while its mani- festation is still minimal and the required response still small.

Rely on Firm, Calm Finesse Achieving compliance is an exercise in purpose, not power. Students need to

follow directions quickly and completely so that they can be assured of having the best chance to succeed. Although that often involves absolute responsiveness

to their teachers, this responsiveness is the means, not the end. “I need your Teach Like a Champion

eyes on me so you can learn,” is a more effective statement than, “I asked for your eyes on me because when I ask you to do something, I expect you to do

it.” While you should expect students to do something when you ask them to, it’s not really about you in the end; it’s about them and their path to college.

Command obedience not because you can or because it feels good but because it serves your students. Make that distinction evident in your language, tone, and

demeanor. 100 Percent teachers stress the universality of expectations. Their language

reinforces this: “I need everyone’s eyes” stresses universality better than, “I need your eyes, Trevor,” though using Trevor’s name may occasionally be necessary,

“I need everyone’s eyes, Trevor,” takes a more direct approach to Trevor while still stressing that the standard is universal. Similarly, 100 Percent teachers are

strategically impersonal. Many teachers think their job is to individualize every decision to the speciﬁc needs and people in every situation. In cases of behavioral

Asking for eyes on you is better than asking for

**attention**, because you can see it when you have it.

Asking for pencils down and eyes on you is better yet, since

it gives you two things you can see.

expectations, this is likely to result in their feeling particularly picked on, espe-

cially when they don’t like the decisions. Reinforcing expectations with a bit of

impersonality (“That’s not how we do it here”; “In this classroom we respond

respectfully to peers”) reminds students that your decisions are not personal.

100 Percent teachers catch it early, before the rest of the class, and some-

times even the students in question, know it’s an “it.”

Emphasize Compliance You Can See You can emphasize compliance in a number of ways:

• Invent ways to maximize visibility. Find ways to make it easier to see who’s followed your directions by asking students to do things you can see. Ask-

ing for eyes on you is better than asking for **attention**, because you can see it when you have it. Asking for pencils down and eyes on you is better yet, since

it gives you two things you can see and because the second thing you’ve asked for—pencils down—is far easier to see in a quick scan of the room than is

eye contact. Averted eyes are subtle and time-consuming to see; a pencil in hand in a room of pencils on desks is easily discerned. This makes it easier for

you to see compliance and results in your students’ recognizing that it is far Setting and Maintaining High Behavioral Expectations 177

harder not to comply, requiring a willfulness that few students are willing to pursue.

• Be seen looking. When you ask for compliance, look for it consistently and be seen looking for it. Every few minutes, scan the room with a calm smile on

your face to ensure that everything is as it should be. When you give a direction, remember to pause and scan the room. Narrating your scan—“Thank you, Peter.

Thank you, Marissa. Eyes right on me, front row”—reinforces that when you ask, you both look to see who’s done it and consistently see what individuals do.

• Avoid marginal compliance. It’s not just whether your students do what you’ve asked but whether they do it right. A certain number will complete a task

only as fully as you show them you expect it completed. They’ll rightly want to know what exactly “eyes on me” means. Eyes near you? Eyes on yours for

a ﬂeeting second? Eyes locked on yours while you’re talking? The difference among these three interpretations is night and day.

• Leverage the power of unacknowledged behavioral opportunities. Stu- dents can gain valuable practice behaving in a constructive and positive manner

without even being aware that they are doing so. For example, they can practice making a habit of following their teacher’s directions. In a classroom where the

teacher uses fun, high-energy Call and ****Response**** (technique 23) teaching, stu- dents practice doing what they’re asked, right on cue, over and over again. They

don’t recognize that they are practicing following commands, just that they’re having fun. And they see their peers doing this as well, which normalizes follow-

through and compliance with the teacher. Over time this has a powerful effect. Students not only build up muscle memory of repeated on-cue compliance, but

they come to expect that instant compliance from their peers and associate it with positive feelings. They are learning to buy in and behave without even

being aware that they are doing so. Teachers who ﬁnd lots of opportunities for students to practice doing what

they ask when they aren’t concerned about behavior ensure a greater likelihood of their success when they are.

# Technique 37

# What to do

Some portion of student noncompliance—a larger portion than many teachers

ever suppose—is caused not by deﬁance but by incompetence: by students’ misunderstanding a direction, not knowing how to follow it, or tuning out in

Teach Like a Champion a moment of benign distraction. Recognizing this means giving directions to

students in a way that provides clear and useful guidance—enough of it to allow any student who wanted to do as asked to do so easily. The name for this

technique is What to Do, and using it makes directions routinely useful and easy to follow.

In schools we spend a lot of time deﬁning the behavior we

want by the negative: ‘‘Don’t get distracted.’’ ‘‘Stop fooling

around.’’ ‘‘That behavior was inappropriate.’’ These

commands are vague, inefﬁcient, and unclear. They

force students to guess what you want them to do.

Four primary characteristics of What to Do

**help** reinforce

accountability among students. In addition, a critical

guiding principle emphasizes differen- tiating between deﬁance and incompe-

tence. Consistently making this crucial distinction will have a pervasive effect

on your classroom culture and relation- ship with students.

What to Do starts, logically, with your telling students what to do—that

is, with not telling them what not to do. In schools we spend a lot of time

deﬁning the behavior we want by the negative: “Don’t get distracted.” “Stop

fooling around.” “That behavior was inappropriate.” These commands are vague, inefﬁcient, and unclear. They force students to guess what you want

them to do. What’s the “it” in, “Cut it out,” for example? Assuming I don’t want to get distracted, if all you tell me is not to do that, what should I now

assume the alternative is and how would I have known that? Even when we don’t deﬁne behavior by the negative, we are often insuf-

ﬁciently helpful. When you tell a student to pay **attention**, ask yourself if she knows how to pay **attention**. Has anyone ever taught her? Does she know your

speciﬁc expectations for paying **attention** (having her eyes on the speaker, say)? Has anyone ever helped her learn to avoid and control distractions and distract-

edness? The command “pay **attention**” provides no useful guidance because it fails to teach.

One of our primary jobs is to tell students what to do and how to do it. Telling students what to do rather than what not to do is not only far more efﬁcient

and effective but it refocuses us, even in moments that are about behavior, on teaching. It expresses the belief that teaching can solve problems. However, just

Setting and Maintaining High Behavioral Expectations 179 telling kids what to do is not quite enough. To be effective, directions should be

speciﬁc, concrete, sequential, and observable: • Speciﬁc. Effective directions are speciﬁc. They focus on manageable and

precisely described actions that students can take. Instead of advising a student to pay **attention**, for example, I might advise him to put his pencil on his desk or

keep his eyes on me. This provides useful guidance that he can take action on and pay **attention** to doing. It is easy to remember, solution oriented, and hard

to misunderstand. • Concrete. Effective directions are not just speciﬁc; they involve, when

possible, clear, actionable tasks that any student knows how to do. If I tell my student to pay **attention**, he may or may not know how to do that, but if I tell

him to put his feet under his desk, I have asked him to do something no student can misunderstand or not know how to do. If he appears to struggle, I can get

more concrete: “Turn your body to face me. Bring your legs around. Put them under your desk. Push in your chair.” These are real things: physical, simple,

commonplace. There is no gray area in this command and no ﬁnesse or prior knowledge required to follow through. And the elimination of such gray area

allows me to better understand the intention of my student. • Sequential. Since a complex skill like paying **attention** is rarely equated

with a single speciﬁc action, effective directions should describe a sequence of concrete speciﬁc actions. In the case of my student who needs **help** paying

**attention**, I might advise him, “John, put your feet under your desk, put your pencil down, and put your eyes on me.” In some cases, I might add, “When I

write it on the board, that means you write it in your notes.” • Observable. I was careful to give John not just a sequence of speciﬁc

steps to follow. I described observable actions: things that I could plainly see him do. This is critical. Since my directions focused on a series of steps that

were speciﬁc and simple enough that any student could reasonably be expected to do them, the observational component of my directions left John with little

wiggle room in terms of his accountability. If I tell him to pay **attention**, I can’t really tell whether he has done so and therefore cannot hold him accountable

very effectively. He will protest, “But I was paying **attention**.” Consciously or unconsciously, students sense and exploit this lack of accountability. However,

if I tell John, “Put your feet under your desk, put your pencil down, and get your eyes on me,” I can see perfectly well whether he has done it. He knows perfectly

well that I can see whether he has done it and is therefore more likely to do it. Teach Like a Champion

What to Do allows you to distinguish between incompetence and deﬁance by making your commands speciﬁc enough that they can’t be deliberately mis-

interpreted and helpful enough that they explain away any gray areas. However, it’s worth considering a bit more the capacity to distinguish between incompe-

tence and deﬁance. If I ask John to pay **attention** or sit up or get on task and he doesn’t, knowing whether he will not or cannot matters deeply. If he cannot,

the problem is incompetence. If he will not, the problem is deﬁance. I respond to these situations differently.

Psychological studies suggest that learned helplessness—

the process of giving up because you believe your own

choices and actions are irrelevant—generally results

from a perception that consequences are random.

If the issue is incompetence, my obligation is to teach John. If I pun-

ish him for not complying when he is unable to do so, the consequence will

seem unjust: I will punish him for what he doesn’t understand or can’t do. This

will erode my relationship with John and teach him that consequences are discon-

nected from his actions. If they happen for reasons he does not fathom, they

are random to him. Psychological studies suggest that learned helplessness—the

process of giving up because you believe your own choices and actions are irrelevant—generally results from a perception that consequences are

random. But if John will not do what I ask, the issue is deﬁance, and my obligation

is to provide a consequence. Unless I act clearly and decisively in the face of a challenge to my authority, John will establish a precedent of impunity. He

and his classmates will now know that John, and arguably anyone else who’s willing to, can successfully challenge me for the rest of the year. When I let

go of my authority in this way, I am abdicating my responsibility to protect the **environment** in which the rest of the students live and learn—and thus their right

to a quality education. If I respond to deﬁance with teaching, I am just as bad off as if I respond to incompetence with punishment.

Therefore, you must distinguish between incompetence and deﬁance, responding to incompetence with teaching and deﬁance with consequence.

Confusing one for the other—and many teachers routinely fail to distinguish them—has damaging consequences in both cases, and this is why making the

distinction reliably and consistently has such far-reaching ramiﬁcations for your classroom. Making the distinction well is probably the most important part

Setting and Maintaining High Behavioral Expectations 181 of What to Do; arguably it is one of the most important tools for building

classroom culture. By giving concrete, speciﬁc, observable directions—simple and clear enough that anyone of good faith could do them if they wanted—you

can make the distinction consistently and fairly. You can task students who are struggling with actions that allow you know the difference so you can teach

when you should teach and exert your authority when you must. What to Do, Version 2

When students fail to follow a direction and you know the cause is incompe- tence or believe that you need further data to determine whether it is, revising

the initial direction, this time by breaking it down into an even more speciﬁc sequence of steps, can **help**. Let’s say I task my students: “Take out your fold-

ers. Find your homework. Place it at the corner of your desk.” Two students fail to do this. They take out their folders but go no further. While the rest of

my class completes the task, I might say to them, “Open your folder, and look in the left-side pocket for your assignment. Take it out, and place it on your

desk. Now close the folder. Good. And put it away.” This reteaches the part of the task that was difﬁcult for the students: providing more guidance where

they were unclear (perhaps they didn’t know where to look in their folders; per- haps they weren’t sure whether I meant they should place their homework or

their folders in the corner of their desks). If that reteaching is unnecessary, it reinforces the students’ accountability for following through. Yes, I am babying

them a little, but I am being very clear that I am aware of the noncompliance, am not rattled by it, and intend to address it. Either way I am more likely to

cause the successful completion of the task or, if not, to reveal more clearly a case of minor deﬁance that I can handle with a consequence and the conﬁdence

that the decision to do so was just. Since this allows me to administer my conse- quences without doubt or hesitation, it allows me to administer them with absolute

consistency. Repeating a What to Do with greater speciﬁcity can also be used in crisis

situations. As a dean of students, I was once called to a classroom where a teacher had tried to send a student to the ofﬁce. The student, volatile and often

deﬁant, had refused to move or to acknowledge the teacher when she had been asked to leave. Instead she put her head down and ignored all directions. With

the entire classroom watching me, I bent down next to her desk and said, quietly and ﬁrmly, “Christina, come with me please.” She didn’t move a muscle. I was

glad I made the initial command quietly and preserving a modicum of privacy but I knew time was running out. By luck or instinct—I was not yet aware of

Teach Like a Champion the What to Do technique—I said, “Christina, push your chair back from your

desk, and stand up beside it.” Lo and behold, that’s exactly what Christina did. “Good,” I said. “Now follow me to the door.”

After that, I used the technique in a variety of crises and found it one of my most reliable tools, especially when confronting a group of students who

needed redirection and were actively reading my level of calm and willingness to assert my authority. I found it helped me to know what to say in situations

where I might otherwise be nervous. Knowing that I would rely on a clear What to Do allowed me to approach tough situations calmly and with a conﬁdence that

increased my likelihood of success: “Gentlemen, please pause your conversation for a moment. I am teaching on the other side of this door. Please pick up your

things, walk to the end of the hall, open the doors, and step outside. You may continue your conversation there.”

# Technique 38

# Strong voice

Some teachers have “it”: they enter a room and are instantly in command. Stu-

dents who moments before seemed beyond the appeal of reason suddenly take their seats to await instructions. It’s hard to say exactly what “it” is and why

some teachers have it. Much of it is surely intangible and nontransferable, a manifestation of the unique power of individuals and their ability to earn respect

and credibility, build relationships, and exude conﬁdence and poise. But even if I can’t tell you exactly how to bottle “it,” I can describe ﬁve concrete things that

“it” teachers consistently use to signal their authority. These are ﬁve techniques anyone, even the seemingly meekest and mildest of novices, can use. Using them

will put you in a position to establish control, command, and the benign author- ity that makes the use of excessive consequences unnecessary. Mastering these

skills may not make you the “it” teacher, but having a Strong Voice will surely get you a lot closer.

Generally Strong Voice teachers follow ﬁve principles in their interactions with students—or at least in the interactions where they are trying to establish

control: Economy of Language, Do Not Talk Over, Do Not Engage, Square Up/Stand Still, and Quiet Power. They also have a default register——a tone

and demeanor they employ in their interactions—that maximizes the power of these ﬁve principles.

Setting and Maintaining High Behavioral Expectations 183

# The five principles of strong voice

Economy of Language

Do Not Talk Over Do Not Engage

Square Up/Stand Still Quiet Power

. • Economy of Language. Fewer words are stronger than more. Demonstrat-

ing economy of language shows that you are prepared and know your purpose in speaking. Being chatty or verbose signals nervousness, indecision, and ﬂippancy.

It suggests that your words can be ignored. When you need your directions fol- lowed, use the words that best focus students on what is most important, and no

more. Don’t dilute urgent issues with things that can wait. Rather than asking students to identify the top priority of the ﬁve points you made in your directions

to them, make just one point. Then you can be sure your students will hear it. Avoid initiating distractions and excess words. When you need to be all business,

be clear and crisp. And then stop talking. • Do Not Talk Over. If what you’re saying is truly worth **attention**, then

every student has the right and the responsibility to hear it. And if what you’re saying is not that important, maybe you shouldn’t be saying it, at least to the

whole class. When you need them to listen, your words must be far and away the most important in the room, so make a habit of showing that they matter.

Before beginning, wait until there is no other talking or rustling. By ensuring that your voice never competes for **attention**, you will demonstrate to students

that their decision to listen isn’t situational (that is, you do it if it seems as if maybe it really matters this time). Moreover, controlling who has the ﬂoor is

the mark of your authority and a necessity to your teaching. If you repeat ten instructions per day at half a minute per **instruction**, you will waste two full days

of school per child over the course of the year. You cannot afford to talk over students.

In some cases, you may need to start in order to stop, that is, start a sentence and break it off to show that you will not go on until you have full **attention**.

Using this self-interrupt to make the fact that they are stopping obvious avoids Teach Like a Champion

the ironic necessity of talking over students to tell students you won’t talk over them. Typically a teacher might plan to address his class with some direction

like this: “Sixth grade, I need your binders out so you can write down the homework correctly.” However, if students were inattentive or if there was noise

or talking persisting after his ﬁrst word or two, he would cut off his own sentence, ideally at the most noticeable place, and remain silent for a few seconds before

starting again: “Sixth grade, I need your . . . ” If the low-level muttering and distractions did not entirely disappear, he might initiate another self-interrupt,

this time with a bit less of the direction given: “Sixth grade, I . . . ” During these interruptions he might stand stock-still to demonstrate that nothing could continue

until attentiveness was restored. Of all the situations in which a

student is likely to try to change topics, the moment in

which you ask her to take accountability for her actions

is among the most likely. .• Do Not Engage. Once you have

set the topic of conversation, avoid engaging in other topics until you have

satisfactorily resolved the topic you ini- tiated. This is especially important when

the topic is behavioral follow-through. Of all the situations in which a stu-

dent is likely to try to change topics, the moment in which you ask her to take

accountability for her actions is among the most likely. Commonly a student will reply with an excuse or a distraction. Suppose, for example, that you say to

David, who is pushing Margaret’s chair with his foot, “Please take your foot off Margaret’s chair.” David might reply, “But she’s pushing me!” or “But she keeps

on moving into my space!” Many teachers might struggle in such a situation by engaging the distraction David has proposed: what Margaret was allegedly doing.

Saying, “Margaret, were you doing that?” or even, “I’m not really concerned with what Margaret was doing,” is a way of responding to David’s choice of topic, not

making him engage yours. A better response would be to say, “David, I asked you to take your foot off Margaret’s chair,” or even, “Right now, I need you to

follow my direction and take your foot off Margaret’s chair.” These responses are better because they make explicit reference to the fact that you initiated a

topic of conversation and expect it to be addressed and because it doesn’t require you to announce that you “don’t care” what Margaret did, which isn’t exactly

the message you want to convey. Another possible reply from David might be, “But I wasn’t doing anything!”

Again, the best strategy is not to engage his topic. After all you wouldn’t have Setting and Maintaining High Behavioral Expectations 185

corrected him if you’d had a question in your mind about whether David’s foot was where it should be. The best reply is, “I asked you to take your foot off

Margaret’s chair. Once you’ve done that, you don’t need to say anything more.” If you did have a question, an effective strategy would be to say, “David, if

your foot is on Margaret’s chair, I need you to put it under your own desk and keep it there.” If he distracts with, “But she was . . . ,” your response is simple.

He’s admitted that his foot is on her chair, and now you merely repeat your request that he remove it. If he says, “It wasn’t on her chair,” then you can simply

reply, “Good. Then it shouldn’t be hard for you to keep it under your desk for the duration of class.” If you think David is likely to test you, you could add, “I’ll

keep an eye on it so I can **help** you practice that at recess if you need the **help**.” A better original direction to David would have been to tell him where to put

his foot rather than where not to put it. After all, there’s no guarantee that the next place he ﬁnds for it will be much better or that he won’t move it back. So

an ideal original command might be something like, “David, please put your feet under your desk and face me.” This command also puts you in a better place

if he removes his foot and claims, “But my foot wasn’t on Margaret’s chair” or “My foot isn’t on Margaret’s chair.” Because you have initiated the topic of

where his foot should be rather than where it shouldn’t be, you can merely repeat your request: “I asked you to put your foot under your desk and to face me. Let

me see you do that now.” This is certainly about your authority, but it’s not only about your authority.

Engaging in this topic allows David to defer consideration of his own account- ability. Students will often seize on this opportunity to convince themselves that

they were not in fact behaving in a negative manner. Ask yourself if you want your kids to get the message that you can change the topic or blame someone

else if you haven’t done your job. Ask yourself if you want them to be able to fool themselves into thinking it was all okay. Thus, insisting that you control

the topic of behavioral conversations ensures accountability by students in your interest, that of their peers (whose interests you represent), and their own.

Refusing to engage establishes a tone of focused accountability in your class- room. Students can’t change the topic. They need to act ﬁrst and explain later.

It also means that the issues of who is bugging whom are more easily delayed until a time when **instruction** is not happening.

Here’s another useful example: ****Teacher****:

(to James, who was talking) James, you are talking. Please move your card to yellow.

Teach Like a Champion James:

It wasn’t me! ****Teacher****:

Please move your card to yellow. James:

Shanice was talking! Not me! ****Teacher****:

I asked you to move your card. Please get up and move your card to yellow.

It may be reasonable for the teacher to discuss who was talking with James (it also may not be), but it needs to be the expectation that the latter conversa-

tion doesn’t happen until James has ﬁrst done what his teacher asked. He can dissent or seek redress. Until he has obeyed the initial request, there is no other

conversation. A ﬁnal situation in which it’s critical not to engage is when students call out

answers. Engaging with the answer, even if you say, “Right, but please don’t call out,” sends the message that if what you call out is interesting enough, the right

answer when no one else can seem to get it, or said loud enough or repeated often enough, then the rules don’t apply. This will rapidly put you in a place where

you are faced with constant calling out. No matter how fascinating the comment or how needed the right answer, if you engage when it is called out, you will

erode your ability to control future conversations in your classroom. No matter how intriguing the answer, it’s better in the long run to remind students of what

to do—“In this class, we raise our hands when we want to speak”—without engaging the answer.

• Square Up/Stand Still. In every comment, you speak nonverbally as well as with your words. Show with your body that you are committed to each request.

When you want to express the seriousness of your directions, turn, with two feet and two shoulders, to face the object of your words directly. Make sure your

eye contact is direct. Stand up straight or lean in close (ironically this shows your level of control by demonstrating that you are not shy or afraid; you don’t

crouch down to a dog you fear will bite you, after all). If the student to whom you are speaking is more than a few feet away, move toward him.

When giving directions that you want followed, stop moving and don’t engage in other tasks at the same time. If you are passing out papers while

you direct students, you suggest that your directions aren’t that important. After all, you’re doing other things at the same time too. At times it may even **help**

take your own words seriously and therefore that they, like you, are formal

and purposeful. .

• Quiet Power. When you get nervous, and are worried that students

might not follow your directions, when you sense that your control may be

slipping away, your ﬁrst instinct is often to talk louder and faster. When you get

loud and talk fast, you show that you are nervous, scared, out of control. You

make visible all the anxieties and send a message to students that they can control you and your emotions—that they can make you anxious and upset,

make you put on a show that’s much more entertaining than revising a paper or nailing coordinate geometry, say. When you get loud, you also, ironically,

make the room louder and thus easier for students to successfully talk under their breath. Though it runs against all your instincts, get slower and quieter

when you want control. Drop your voice, and make students strain to listen. Exude poise and calm.

# See it in action: clip 17

# Strong voice

In clip 17 on the DVD, Sultana Noormuhammad of Leadership Prep Bedford

Stuyvesant demonstrates Strong Voice. While she’s reading about penguins with her kids, there’s an interruption (what sounds like a hiccup). Noor-

muhammad responds with a self-interruption, reinforcing the expectation that she will not talk over voices or other distractions. She emphasizes the

importance of student **attention** by ‘‘squaring up’’ to face the noise and remaining absolutely still for a second. She leverages economy of language,

eschewing the lecture that might come with her intervention. In this case, it’s pretty clear why she stopped. It also shows how important it is to ‘‘catch

it early’’ (the ‘‘it’’ being off-task behavior, as discussed in 100 Percent). When you catch it early, you can correct with a much smaller and less

Teach Like a Champion invasive intervention, often one that doesn’t require a discussion with the

whole class: ‘‘Class, when I am talking, I need you to . . . ’’ That may **help** set expectations, but it also calls lots of **attention** to noncompliance and thus

normalizes it. Little ﬁxes, like the one Noormuhammad uses here, often don’t require narration.

Note a visible contrast between her formal register in the moment of her Strong Voice intervention and her warmer and chattier style when

she’s discussing **content** with her students.

# Formal pose: the default register of strong

# Voice teachers

Imagine three interactions between colleagues at work. The workplace may be

a school but it doesn’t have to be. In the ﬁrst **interaction**, a woman tells her colleague about her recent weekend. Maybe they’re in the lunch area at work.

“Oh my gosh, it was such a great weekend,” begins the ﬁrst. She’s recounting a trip with some friends to a nearby city. As she does so, her eye contact drifts

away from and comes back to her colleague, as if she was gazing out at some latent image of the weekend projected on a nearby wall. Her hands move as she

describes it. “We were in this funky coffee shop with old records up the walls,” she says, as her hands make a sweeping gesture alluding to the locations of said

vinyl. She stands with her hips to the side, reclining against a wall perhaps. She’s squinting slightly. Her weight is on one foot. Her words run together in a pitter-

patter-like rhythm. All of these things—her inconsistent eye contact; her use of extensive, sweeping gestures; her asymmetrical, relaxed posture; her words

running into one another as if each was not so critical in its own right but part of a larger narrative—suggest casualness, informality, a sense of ease. We’re just

talking here, she seems to say. You can interrupt me anytime. If you have to walk away in the middle to do something else, that’s okay too.

Register is the word I’ll use to describe the tenor of a conversation, encom- passing eye contact, body position, gestures, facial expression, and rhythm of

language. The register of this conversation is casual, and many teachers use something like it in the classroom. It’s ﬁne to do so if you’re aware of what it

signals: We’re just talking here. You can walk away at any time. I’m telling you a story as I talk, and you just need to get the general gist of it. The problem is that

Setting and Maintaining High Behavioral Expectations 189 teachers often deliver an important message in a casual register that ultimately

undercuts it. There may be times when you can tell a student, “I need you to sit up” in a casual register, but using it generally suggests discretion for the listener:

you are telling a story; the listener just needs to get the general gist and can walk away at any time. “Sit up if you feel like it” is what the casual register says.

And if it contradicts the words the teacher is using, it’s likely to win out. Now imagine a second conversation in which our speaker suddenly adjusts

to a more formal register. She stands up straight and holds her body symmetrical. She looks directly at her colleague. Her chin rises slightly. She puts her hands

behind her back (no wide, sweeping gestures here; in fact you can’t even see her hands). You couldn’t read or get distracted by her gestures even if you wanted

to because you can’t see her hands. The speaker could be saying anything, but let’s imagine her reciting the pledge of allegiance. “I pledge allegiance,” she

says, “to the ﬂag.” There’s a clear distinction between her words now. Each is an important part of the solemn ritual. Her articulation of the syllables is clearer.

She doesn’t ask her colleague to strike the formal hands-behind-the-back pose she’s using, but when the colleague sees it, she knows something important is

happening and is likely to stand up straight herself and maybe even put her own hands behind her back in unconscious mimicry.

A formal register, it turns out, bespeaks the importance of the message and causes a purposeful attentiveness in the listener. And transplanted into the class-

room, that’s powerful. Imagine our teacher now approaching a student with her hands clasped behind her back. She stands symmetrically and leans in ever so

slightly toward the student in question. Her eyes are steady. In controlled words with distinct pauses between them, she says, “I need you to sit up.” She makes

no further movements. Her register communicates importance, focus, and calm authority. It supports her message. As you can probably guess, champion teach-

ers tend to use the formal register for the great majority of their statements in which they seek control. Watch them in action, and you’ll see them standing

straight and symmetrically, choosing words carefully, with brief pauses between words, eyes held steady. If they make a hand gesture, it’s controlled and sim-

ple, involving one movement and ending succinctly. This formal register is the wrapping that makes Strong Voice especially effective.

What about a sense of urgency? Imagine our two colleagues in a third con- versation. The building is on ﬁre. The ﬁrst colleague enters the lunch area. She

places her hands ﬁrmly on the shoulders of her colleague. “Listen,” she says. “There’s an emergency. I need you to come with me right away. I need you to

put everything down and follow me. Do you understand? Good. Let’s go.” She’s Teach Like a Champion

leaning in closer than she would in a mere formal pose, and she’s punching her words. The pauses are actually more noticeable, though you might have expected

her to rush. Her eyes are locked more than steady. She makes a gesture toward the ﬁre exit with a crisp, truncated, chopping motion. She is not panicked, not

blathering and rushed—just singularly focused. Is this the tone you want to use in your classroom to ensure compliance?

Maybe and maybe not. If the chips are truly down—if the building is, metaphorically, on ﬁre—an

urgent register can work but only if it is delivered as urgent (calm, focused, and very insistent) and not panicked (emotional, hurried, and anxious). But urgency

can also be like crying wolf. It has to be saved for truly urgent situations and most control-oriented interactions should be of the garden variety: made early

in the process before things become urgent. Overused, urgency shows weakness and lack of control. But in the rare situations when it’s needed, it can be useful.

Again, it must be distinguished from a panicky register—a “you have me rattled” register. Those are never useful.

If you watch champion teachers for long enough, you will see that a large percentage of interactions in which control is at stake happen in the formal

register. Again they do not conduct every **interaction** in the formal register; in fact, like the ﬁve Strong Voice principles generally, it is not for the moments when

you’re discussing the Civil War, two-variable equations, or Of Mice and Men. It’s for the moments in between when you need students attentive, ready, and

focused so you can have a worthwhile discussion of the Civil War, two-variable equations, or Of Mice and Men.

# Putting the strong voice techniques together

In his third-grade classroom, Darryl Williams’s Strong Voice drives a clear and

compelling culture. He has the ability to demonstrate all ﬁve techniques within a sequence of just a few seconds to bring his class to order, as he does in this

example. Having completed a study of preﬁxes and sufﬁxes at the board, Williams turns

to explain what’s next on the agenda. “Okay,” he begins. “Let’s see who’s . . . ,” but his voice pulls up abruptly, demonstrating a refusal to talk over students. Two

or three boys are waving their hands in the air while he is talking. Two others are talking to a classmate. Someone’s head is down on the desk. “Well, most of

us are doing an excellent job today,” he says, dropping his voice to just above a whisper. He puts the book he was holding down. He turns to face the class and

places his arms behind his back in a formal Square Up pose. Quietly, slowly, Setting and Maintaining High Behavioral Expectations 191

and ﬁrmly, he says, “Please put your hands down,” focusing the boys’ **attention** on the request with strict economy of language. His refusal to take hands is

yet another way to avoid engaging in a topic other than the one of his own choosing.

The distractions are gone now. The room is silent. All eyes are on him. For Williams, though, there’s one more step: the task of making his actions

transparent and benign. “Thank you,” he says, showing his appreciation for their rapid return to full attentiveness. “The reason I can’t answer all your questions

right now . . . I would like to, and I love it when you tell me intelligent things. But we don’t have a lot of time. We still need to read our story and then . . . ” For

Williams, the strength is not just in the control but in the caring. His explanation of the rationale behind his authority ensures his ability to sustain that control,

with students’ buy-in, for the long haul.

# Technique 39

# Do it again

Getting lots of practice helps students improve, so giving them more practice

is the perfect response to a situation where they show they’re not up to speed at a simple task. That’s the idea behind Do It Again. When students fail to

successfully complete a basic task that you’ve shown them how to do—line up, come in quietly—doing it again and doing it right, or better, or perfectly is often

the best consequence. Do It Again is especially effective for seven reasons:

1. It shortens the feedback loop. Behavioral science has shown that the shorter

the time lag between an action and a response, the more effective the response will be in changing the behavior. Having kids stay in for recess three hours

after the action that caused that consequence is less likely to create a disin- centive than is a response, even an apparently lesser one, that happens right

away. If the reaction comes immediately after, while the original action is fresh in a student’s mind, the two will be more deeply associated in his or her

memory. Doing It Again shortens the feedback loop in comparison to almost any other consequence.

2. It sets a standard of excellence, not just compliance. Do It Again is appro-

priate not just for times when students fail to do something or do it in a way Teach Like a Champion

that’s wrong; it’s ideal for times when students do something acceptably but could do it better. Saying, “That was good; but I want great,” or “In this class,

we do everything as well as we can, including lining up,” allows a teacher to set a standard of excellence, where good can always be better and better

can always shoot for best. At its best, this can drive your classroom culture by replacing acceptable with excellent, ﬁrst in the small things and then in all

things. 3.

There is no administrative follow-up. Do It Again is a consequence that requires no forms to be ﬁlled out, no parent phone calls, no brieﬁng for

administrators. The consequence is done as soon as the goal is reached. In the life of a busy teacher, that’s a blessing. And because it requires no detention

policy or schoolwide rewards systems, Do It Again is almost completely free-standing. It can be used in any classroom.

4. There is group accountability. Though individuals can easily be asked to

Do It Again, the technique is especially effective as a group consequence. One or two students talk while everyone is lining up, and they all try it again.

This holds the group accountable in a reasonable, nonpunitive way for the behavior of all of its individuals. It builds incentives for individuals to behave

positively since it makes them accountable to their peers as well as their teacher.

5. It ends with success. The last thing you remember of an event often shapes

your perception of it more broadly. Do It Again ends not with punishment or failure but with success. The last thing students do in a sequence is to do an

activity the right way. This helps engrain the perception and memory of what right looks like. It also helps build muscle memory. Students built the habit

of doing it right, over and over. 6.

There are logical consequences. Ideal consequences are logically related to the behavior that precedes them. The idea is that this connection helps

students to understand what they did wrong and what’s expected of them in terms of doing it better or differently. A consequence of lining up again and

lining up better is more logically related to a failure to line up well than is a consequence of staying in at recess.

7. It is reusable. Do It Again can be reused. You can Do It Again and then do

it another time if necessary. And you can do the same thing again ten min- utes later. Within reason, it doesn’t lose its legs. You don’t need to keep

Setting and Maintaining High Behavioral Expectations 193 inventing new consequences. You can be positive in administering the third

iteration: “I still think we can do this even better. Let’s give it one more shot!” Add a stopwatch to some routines and the challenge of Do It Again and better

only gets more powerful.

# Do it again scenarios

•

A class transitioning from math to lunch •

A class transitioning from writing in their journals to reading aloud •

A class transitioning from gym to reading class •

A class that needs to track the speaker •

A class that gives a halfhearted Call and ****Response**** (technique 23) •

A class moving from their desks to a small group reading area .

One colleague suggested that a better name for this

technique is Do It Better as it better captures the idea that

doing things over again to be as good as you can be is what

school is about. The goal is not mere compliance but

excellence, even in the little things.

Given these advantages, it’s no won- der that champion teachers use Do It

Again so often. However, it’s impor- tant to do the technique well. Do It

Again should be positive whenever pos- sible, with a keen focus on getting bet-

ter and, in a great classroom, informed by a constant narrative of “good, better,

best.” That is, just doing it gets replaced by doing it well. In fact one colleague

suggested that a better name for this technique was Do It Better as it better

captured the idea that doing things over again to be as good as you can be is what

school is about. The goal, again, is not mere compliance but excellence, even in the little things.

Do It Again can be an effective tool for managing affect. Sometimes people’s attitudes change from the outside in. Asking a low-energy class to repeat some-

thing with enthusiasm (especially, and critically, while modeling those attributes Teach Like a Champion

yourself) can start to be a self-fulﬁlling prophecy. Do It Again is a great opportu- nity to challenge students positively to show you their best at something. Saying,

“Oooh, let’s line up again and prove why we’re the best reading group in the school,” is often better that saying, “Class, that was very sloppy. We’re going to

do it again until we get it exactly right,” even if the purpose is to Do It Again until you get it exactly right.

# Key idea

# Do it again

Doing it again and doing it right, or better, or perfect is often

the best consequence. And here’s one additional hint about using Do It Again. Teachers tend to

think that they need to wait until an entire routine or activity is done before asking the class to try it again. In fact, you should have students go back and try

it again as soon as you know the level of execution will not meet the standard you set for it. Don’t wait for the routine to end. Again, this will better connect

the stimulus to the response. Let’s say students are lining up for lunch, and the drill is to stand up quietly, push in their chairs, turn to face the door, and then

follow the table leader to the door. If students forget to push in their chairs, have them sit back down and try it again right then. Don’t wait until you get to the

door to announce that some students forgot to push in their chairs. This saves time and reinforces instant accountability.

# See it in action: clip 18

# Do it again

In clip 18 on the DVD, Suzanne Vera of Leadership Prep Bedford Stuyvesant

demonstrates Do It Again. She’s also investing in discipline by teaching her Setting and Maintaining High Behavioral Expectations 195

students the right way to do things and practice. Her practice is designed to ensure that they practice successfully by simplifying the ﬁrst few times.

Vega has cleverly arranged to practice ﬁrst without materials (‘‘Pretend you’re drawing!’’) that might distract her students and get in the way the

ﬁrst few times she teaches a procedure. You’ll probably notice right away in the clip how positive Vera’s

tone is. Vera tells her students, ‘‘That was good but it could be great,’’ before they try it the second time. She also gives them speciﬁc feedback

about how to be better by describing the solution and not the prob- lem: ‘‘You need to be looking at me’’; ‘‘Remember that you turn your neck if

you can’t see me.’’ The feedback lives in the now. Consider two last thoughts about this wonderful clip. First, some

teachers might assume that students would naturally grouse about having to do basic tasks over and over again to get better at them. As it happens,

and as Vera’s teaching ably demonstrates, students are more often quite happy practicing and getting better, especially when the practice is framed

positively, because they enjoy being successful and getting better at things. If you don’t believe that, watch how these kids react. Second, notice that

Vega’s use of the stopwatch makes an implicit challenge to kids that she is set up to make explicit in the future: ‘‘Yesterday we cleaned up in twelve

seconds; let’s see if we can do it in ten today!’’ You can read more about how teachers like Suzanne Vera make

their correction so upbeat in Positive Framing (technique 43 in Chapter Seven).

# Technique 40

# Sweat the details

In any **environment**, countless apparently minor details signal the expectations

for conduct and behavior to residents, even if those individuals don’t recognize that they are responding. This is the idea behind the broken windows theory

of policing. Erase grafﬁti, ﬁx broken windows, and combat minor but common disruptions in lawfulness, and people perceive their **environment** to be orderly

and safe. They will then act to preserve it, not degrade it. Teach Like a Champion

Sweat the Details puts this theory to work in your classroom. To reach the highest standards, you must create the perception of order. Clean up clutter,

keep desk rows tidy, make sure shirts are tucked in and hats are off, and you will decrease the likelihood that you will have to deal with more serious issues

because you will decrease your students’ perception that those things might be permissible. If students think the front line of their struggle to test the rules is

seeing what color socks they can get away with under uniform guidelines, they are far less likely to consider other ways of testing the rules.

The key to Sweat the Details is preparation. Planning for orderliness means putting systems in place in advance that make accomplishing the goal quick

and easy. •

Want your students’ desks in neat rows? (The answer should be yes.) Try putting tape marks on the ﬂoor so you can instruct students to “check their

desks” and move them onto their marks. •

Want your students to do neat and tidy homework? Give students a homework standards rubric and occasionally (or frequently) collect assignments one at a

time from each student’s desk when they complete independent work, giving brief feedback on neatness to students as you circulate. “I don’t see a name on

this, Charles.” “Is this your best work, Tani?” “You know I won’t accept this with fringe on the paper, Danny.” This will eliminate the anonymity of turning

in homework and make students feel personally accountable. •

Want your students to keep their materials neatly in their binders and never lose them? Put materials in binders in a group the ﬁrst ﬁfty times, teaching the

students how to do it as you go: “We’re going to put these at the front of your vocabulary section. Get ready, and we’ll open our binders on three. Ready?”

• Want your students to work carefully on their seat work? Circulate as they

work, offering brief corrections as you go. “Check your spelling of daily, James.” “One of your ﬁrst two sentences isn’t complete, Mehmet.”

• Want your students to raise their hands quietly and crisply to foster orderly

participation? Teach them how to raise their hands and remind them “how we raise our hands here” frequently.

In planning for these kinds of actions, you will not only solve persistent low- level issues that plague classrooms but will change students’ perception about

your classroom, making it seem an orderly and organized place where it’s hard to imagine disorder rearing its head.

Setting and Maintaining High Behavioral Expectations 197

# Technique 41

# Threshold

The most important moment to set expectations in your classroom is the minute

when your classroom students enter or, if they are transitioning within a class- room, when they formally begin their **lesson**. The ﬁrst minute, when students

cross the threshold into the classroom, you must remind them of the expecta- tions. It’s the critical time to establish rapport, set the tone, and reinforce the

ﬁrst steps in a routine that makes excellence habitual. With culture, getting it right and keeping it right is much easier than ﬁxing it once it’s gone wrong.

Threshold ensures that you make a habit of getting it right from the outset each day.

Ideally you will ﬁnd a way to greet your students by standing in the physical threshold of the classroom—astride the door, taking the opportunity to remind

students where they are (they are with you now; no matter what the expectations are elsewhere, you will always expect their best), where they are going (to col-

lege), and what you will demand of them (excellence and effort). Typically each student who enters shakes your hand, looks you in the eye, and offers a civil and

cordial greeting. (Some teachers use more informal variations on this.) Use the greeting to engage students brieﬂy and build rapport: “Loved your

homework, David”; “Nice game last night, Shayna”; “Looking for great things from you today, Mr. Williams!”; “Oh my gosh, your hair looks great, Shanice!”

You can occasionally (or always) greet the procession of students through the doorway with a description of what’s to come and a reminder of what’s expected:

“We have a quiz today. Be sure to prepare your materials, then begin the Do Now. It will **help** you review. Okay, let’s go.” You should also use the threshold to set

expectations by correcting weak handshakes, untidy attire, or lack of eye contact. Fortunately, this is easy to do since Threshold allows for its own simple implicit

consequence. Get it wrong, and you go back in the line and try it again, and when you meet the expectations of the room, you enter on good terms. Incidentally,

this is another reason for using a handshake: it allows you to control access to the room. If a student walks past with head down and without a greeting, you

can always just hold on to his or her hand and not let go until the resulting eye contact allows you to gently correct the behavior.

Threshold will naturally take on a tone and feel in keeping with your own tone and style: it can be outgoing or quiet, warm or crisp. Yet no matter the

affect, Threshold should always accomplish two things: (1) establish a personal Teach Like a Champion

connection between you and your students by a brief personal check-in (ideally one in which you greet each student by name), and (2) reinforce your classroom

expectations. Dacia Toll adds a slightly different ﬂavor to the greeting she offers each

of her sixth-grade writing students at New Haven’s Amistad Academy. “Good morning, Sisuelas,” she says to one student as she shakes her hand. “Nice to see

you again, Sandria.” Her air of conviviality expresses to each student her genuine interest in and enjoyment of their presence. When one student greets her with

a slightly-too-informal, “Hey, what up?” she responds, warmly, “ ‘What up’ is not appropriate,” gently holding his hand as he passes and directing him to the

back of the line. A few seconds later, he greets her with a “good morning” and, without retribution, she nods: “Good morning, Jabali.” Her tone remains warm

and **kind**. His test of the limits is utterly natural, she knows, and her response explains her expectations rather than chastising or punishing. Having the chance

to try it again is the benign consequence, and he enters the class smiling as well. At North Star Academy in Newark, New Jersey, Jamey Verilli adds a few

wrinkles of his own. As his students wait outside the classroom, he quizzes them on last night’s vocabulary words. “Okay, tilled. Who would do tilling,

and what **kind** of work was it?” Verilli asks. The message is powerful: every minute matters; we are in school even when we are not in class. After a brief

preamble—“Okay, gentlemen, when you come in, you need to set your desk with your homework at the top. Your Do Now today is going to require you

to spell some of these words we’ve been studying. Clear?” Verilli posts himself in the door jamb. Like Toll, he offers a personal greeting as he shakes each

student’s hand. Verilli’s version is a bit more muscular but still kindly. He refers to students by their last names: “Good afternoon, Mr. Mumford. Good afternoon,

Mr. Reeves.” A young Mr. Early slouches a bit and glances away. “Stand up straight and give me good grip,” Verilli responds, and Mr. Early quite happily

does just that. He seems to like the expectations for him, as if it signals to him his own importance. Two students later, young Mr. Smallwood approaches, wearing

a new pair of glasses. “Looking sharp, Mr. Smallwood! I like it!” Verilli cheers, his upbeat demeanor all the more compelling for the tone of formality it breaks.

Mr. Smallwood beams up at him, shaking his teacher’s hand ﬁrmly. Things are not going quite so swimmingly for Mr. Merrick, who has been talking. “Step

out [of the room],” Verilli commands, as he sends Mr. Merrick back to get his entrance to the classroom just right.

In these classrooms, the mood is warm but industrious. All of the students are hard at work just a few seconds after hitting the door—even Mr. Merrick, who

Setting and Maintaining High Behavioral Expectations 199 is soon settled, redirected, and ready for class, compelling evidence of the power

of Threshold to set expectations from the outset. Occasionally teachers insist that it’s impossible for them to greet their stu-

dents at the door: their school forbids students to wait outside the class in the hallway, or the teacher moves to the students rather than vice versa. When a

greeting at the door is impossible, invent another ritual to signify that something formal has begun: students rise, and you and they greet one another at the begin-

ning of each class. The point is not so much the doorway as the power of ritual to **help** kids see that your classroom is different from the other places they go.

As a teacher, I almost always found that if I was angry with my students, I

had waited too long to address issues or that I was not using consequences consistently. Using minor interventions and small consequences that you can

administer fairly and without hesitation before a situation gets emotional is the key to maintaining control and earning students’ respect. Relying on personal

charm, emotion, or similar aspects of your relationships to get students to do what’s expected of them also risks missing the point. It’s not about you. Students

are not supposed to behave to please you; they are supposed to behave so they can better themselves, be the best people they can be, and get the most out of school.

Your goal should be to take action rather than to get angry: •

Act early. Try to see the favor you are doing kids in catching off-task behav- ior early and using a minor intervention of consequence to prevent a major

consequence later. This is a good thing. •

Act reliably. Be predictably consistent, sufﬁcient to take the variable of how you will react out of the equation and focus students on the action that precipi-

tated your response. •

Act proportionately. Start small when the misbehavior is small; don’t go nuclear unless the situation is nuclear.

The behavior that most often gets in the way of taking action is the warning. Giving a warning is not taking action; it is threatening that you might take an

action and therefore is counterproductive. Warnings tell students that a certain Teach Like a Champion

amount of disobedience will not only be tolerated but is expected. Teachers are in effect saying, “It’s okay once. If you do it twice, I’m going to start to get

annoyed. But the third time around, well then, you’re at the limit.” If you do this, you should expect students to take full advantage of their two free passes. If your

expectations and rules are deliberately ignored and you don’t take action (with an intervention that corrects it or a consequence), they are neither expectations

nor rules. I am not saying that you must use a consequence every time students fail

to meet your expectations. As discussed in What to Do, it’s critical that you not punish students when the issue is incompetence (rather than deﬁance). If the

issue is incompetence, your response can be a consequence (a Do It Again or perhaps, “We don’t have more time now, but let’s practice what this looks like

a little more after class”) or a clear directive (“Put your legs under your desk, put your pencil down, and keep your eyes on me”). Either way, your response

to incompetence should teach a student how to comply It’s also ﬁne to offer a general reminder to all students about common expec-

tations when they begin to slide. Stamina issues are not deﬁance issues. It’s ﬁne to offer a reminder to an individual student who may not recognize, as you do,

that she is slipping off task. Students who are trying in good faith deserve the beneﬁt of the doubt and can be corrected using management techniques (detailed,

for example, in 100 Percent). However, once you have determined that a behavior is the result of disobedi-

ence rather than incompetence, that it is deliberate, a consequence is better than a warning. A warning countenances the fact a student disobeyed you and makes

public that no consequence has resulted. It calls **attention** to the fact that you recognized the situation and did nothing. And if the behavior is not intentionally

disobedient, a useful correction is also better than a warning since it ﬁxes the situation. A warning merely discusses the outcome of further bad choices.

The key to delivering on consequences is developing a scaled system of incrementally larger consequences that you can deliver reliably, fairly, and with-

out hesitation. This will allow you to be consistent, which is the only way to extinguish behavior. It will also keep you from accidentally weakening yourself.

If you use your biggest consequence right away, there is nothing left to play for, and your students will know this. They will have nothing more to gain or lose,

and their behavior will reﬂect this loss of incentives. Spend time planning your responses in advance, even mapping out a

sequence. For example you might ﬁrst require students to repeat an action more appropriately. Next you might require them to apologize. Next you might take

Setting and Maintaining High Behavioral Expectations 201 away a small piece of a privilege (part of recess) or give several minutes of

detention. Next you might plan to take away an entire privilege for a period of time (no recess today; a full hour of detention) and also make a phone call to

a parent. Or you might scale your responses using a consequence system like colored behavior cards (with elementary schools students), scholar dollars (with

middle school students), or demerits (with high school students). Issue consequences in these ways:

• Be calm, poised, and impersonal, not angry or vindictive (see Emotional Con-

stancy, technique 47 in the next chapter). ****Focus**** on the now: “Show me your best from here on out.” Move on quickly.

• Be incremental. When possible, take things away in pieces. Keep incentives in

play if you can. •

Be private when you can and public when you must. If a behavior doesn’t affect anyone else, deal with it privately. If a student has appeared to get

away with something in front of the class, the class needs to know there was accountability. They don’t need all the details, but they need to know action

was taken. In doing so, you will likely make the necessity of giving consequences more

and more infrequent, which is, of course, the goal.

# Reflection and practice

1.

For each of the common off-task behaviors listed below, write down and practice with a friend or in front a mirror a nonverbal

intervention you could use while you were teaching to correct it: •

****Student**** slouched in his chair •

****Student**** with her head down on her desk, eyes up •

****Student**** with her head down on her desk, eyes hidden •

****Student**** gesturing distractingly to another student •

****Student**** persistently looking under his desk for an unidentiﬁed something.

Teach Like a Champion 2.

For each of the off-task behaviors in question 1, script a posi- tive group correction and an anonymous individual correction to

address them. 3.

Make a list of at least ﬁve positive student behaviors you could reinforce with nonverbal interventions. Plan a signal for each.

4. Revise the following statements using What to Do to make them

speciﬁc, concrete, observable, and sequential: •

‘‘Class, you should be writing this down!’’ •

‘‘Tyson, stop fooling around.’’ •

‘‘Don’t get distracted, Avery.’’ •

‘‘Are you paying **attention**, Dontae?’’ •

‘‘I’d like to get started, please, class.’’ 5.

The next time you host a social event, practice Threshold by greeting each guest at the door with a short, personalized greeting.

# Chapter seven 

# Building character And trust

The meaning of a message changes subtly, drastically, and often completely

depending on the setting and tone of its delivery. In a school, the challenge of effective communication is exacerbated by the sheer number of settings in

which you are required to communicate, not to mention the range of topics you must cover.

Your conversation with Steven at the close of school on Wednesday, one of hundreds you hold this week, may be conducted, depending on the details,

in private, in quasi-private (overheard by others), or in public. If there is an audience, they may be few or many; foes, allies, authorities, or admired peers

(of yours and of Stevens). Your purpose may be to correct, praise, inquire, or instruct. You may be referencing previous conversations, explicit or implicitly.

You may be preparing for future conversations. You may be seeking to change his perception of himself, of you, of school work, of education, of his peers, of certain

values, of who he can be. You may be attempting to do this with humor, warmth, sternness, subtlety, or bluntness. Steven (and you) may be angry, elated, upset,

impassive, defensive, motivated, or grateful. You may be late for class. You may urgently need to use the bathroom. Steven may not realize this, and vice versa.

In this conversation, you may affect Steven’s actions today, tomorrow, or next year. You may change his perceptions of you or school. You will assuredly (and

without realizing it) change your perceptions of your work: Are you successful? Are you changing lives? Are you respected? Is it worth it? Should you just get

Teach Like a Champion your real estate license? In short, the conversation with Steven, like all others,

is a high-wire act. You will need some rules, not just for the words but for the tone you strike in talking to Steven.

# Technique 43

# Positive framing

People are motivated by the positive far more than the negative. Seeking success

and happiness will spur stronger action than seeking to avoid punishment. Psy- chological studies repeatedly show that people are far more likely to be spurred

to action by a vision of a positive outcome than they are to avoid a negative one. This fact should inﬂuence the way you teach. It doesn’t mean that you shouldn’t

be meticulous about responding to off-task or nonconstructive behavior. You still need to ﬁx and improve behavior, and you need to do so consistently and with

clear and ﬁrm consequences when necessary. But as you do these things Positive Framing argues that your interventions will be far more effective if they frame

positively. Using Positive Framing means making interventions to correct student

behavior in a positive and constructive way. It does not mean avoiding interventions so you can talk instead only about the positive behavior you see.

Doing the former is teaching kids (“disciplining” them in the sense of teaching them the right way to do things) in an optimistic, upbeat, conﬁdent manner.

Doing the latter is abdicating your responsibility. If David is off task, it will not be sufﬁcient merely to praise Kelsey for being on task. Rather, you should

correct David in a positive manner. Nonetheless, some teachers might potentially interpret this technique as

an admonition to avoid correcting nonproductive behavior and focus exclusively on reinforcing positive behavior. Reinforcing positive behavior matters, and

it is discussed in the next technique, Precise Praise, but by itself reinforcing positive behavior is insufﬁcient. The greatest power of Positive Framing is its

capacity to allow you to talk about nonconstructive behavior consistently and correct it positively so that you guide students to improved knowledge and

action. Doing that successfully takes some hard work but is in the end highly positive.

# Key idea

# Positive framing

Make corrections consistently and positively. Narrate the

world you want your students to see even while you are relentlessly improving it.

Positive Framing corrects and guides behavior by following six rules: 1. Live in the now. In public—that is, in front of your class or while your

**lesson** is under way—avoid harping on what students can no longer ﬁx. Talk about what should or even must happen next. If necessary, you can do this ﬁrmly

and forcefully (see What to Do, technique 37), but you should focus corrective interactions on the things students should do right now to succeed from this point

forward. There’s a time and place for processing what went wrong; avoid making that time when your **lesson** hangs in the balance. Give instructions describing

what the next move on the path to success is. Say, “Show me SLANT!” not, “You weren’t SLANTing.” Say, “Keana, I need your eyes forward,” not, “Keana,

stop looking back at Tanya.” Don’t attribute to ill intention

what could be the result of distraction, lack of practice, or

genuine misunderstanding. .2. Assume the best. Don’t attribute

to ill intention what could be the result of distraction, lack of practice, or gen-

uine misunderstanding. Until you know an action was intentional, your public

discussion of it should remain positive, showing that you assume your students

have tried (and will try) to do as you’ve asked. Saying, “Just a minute, class. Some people don’t seem to think they have to push in their chairs when we

line up,” or “Just a minute, class. I asked for chairs pushed in, and some people decided not to do it,” assumes that the problem had to be connected to ill inten-

tions and negative characteristics: selﬁshness; deliberate disrespect, laziness. Not only is it more positive to say, “Just a minute, class. Some people seem to have

Teach Like a Champion forgotten to push in their chairs,” or “Whoops. The chair part seems to have

slipped our minds, so let’s go back and get it right,” to show your faith and trust in your students, but it costs you nothing since you can still deliver a consequence

and in fact can deliver exactly the same consequence. You can still assume the best even while you are delivering a consequence. In fact, by no longer making

intentionality a prerequisite for consequence, you uncouple consequences from much of the emotion they carry. It is no longer a judgment (“You did this on

purpose, and here is my revenge”) and more a tool for improvement (“We do things a certain way, and we ﬁx it when we fail to do that, no matter why we

failed”). Furthermore, assuming the worst makes you appear weak. If you show that

you assume your students are always trying to comply with your wishes, you are also demonstrating the assumption that you’re in charge. “If you can’t sit

up, Charles, I’ll have to keep you in from recess,” reveals your suspicion that Charles will disobey you. On the ﬁrst try, say, “Show me your best SLANT,

Charles,” and walk away (for the moment) as if you couldn’t imagine a world in which he wouldn’t do it. Or say something like, “Charles, I need your eyes,”

which asserts nothing about Charles’s intention, only what he needs to do. One particularly effective way to assume the best is to thank students as you

give them a command. This again underscores your assumption that they will follow through. “Thank you for taking your seats in 3-2-1 . . . ”

3. Allow plausible anonymity. Allow students the opportunity to strive to reach your expectations in plausible anonymity as long as they are making a

good-faith effort. Begin by correcting them without using their names when possible. If a few students struggle to follow your directions, consider making

your ﬁrst correction something like: “Check yourself to make sure you’ve done exactly what I’ve asked.” In most cases, this will yield results faster than calling

out laggards unless the laggards are deliberately ﬂouting you. Saying to your class, “Wait a minute, Morehouse (or “Tigers” or “ﬁfth grade” or just “guys”),

I hear calling out. I need to see you quiet and ready to go!” is better than lecturing the callers-out in front of the class. And as with assuming the best,

you can still administer many consequences while preserving anonymity: “Some people didn’t manage to follow directions the whole way, so let’s try that again.”

When there is no good-faith effort by students, it may no longer be possible to maintain anonymity, but naming names shouldn’t be your ﬁrst move. Also, it’s

important to remember both that you can deliver consequences anonymously and that doing so stresses shared responsibility among your students. Some students

weren’t doing their job and we all own the consequence. Building Character and Trust 207

4. Build momentum, and narrate the positive. In the world of sports, momentum, the force that drives some teams forward to great achievements on

a tide of energy, is sometimes known as “Big Mo.” Everybody wants Big Mo, but only some people know how to get it to show up. Compare the statements

two teachers recently made in their respective classrooms: ****Teacher**** 1: (Stopping before giving a direction) I need three people. Make sure

you ﬁx it if that’s you! Now I need two. We’re almost there. Ah, thank you. Let’s get started.

****Teacher**** 2: (Same setting) I need three people. And one more student doesn’t seem to understand the directions, so now I need four. Some people

don’t appear to be listening. I am waiting, gentlemen. If I have to give detentions, I will.

In the ﬁrst teacher’s classroom, things appear to be moving in the right direc- tion because the teacher narrates the evidence of his own command, of students

doing as they’re asked, of things getting better. He calls his students’ **attention** to this fact, thereby normalizing it. Students are arguably more accountable for

their behavior in the ﬁrst room, but nobody seems to notice because failure seems so unlikely.

The second teacher is telling a story that no one wants to hear: from the outset, students can smell the fear, the weakness, and the inevitable unhappy

ending. Everything is wrong and getting worse, generally without consequence. Students can hardly fear accountability when their teacher is describing their

peers’ impunity (“Some people don’t appear to be listening”). You won’t ﬁnd Big Mo in that room!

Consider the same two teachers yet again: ****Teacher**** 1: (After giving a direction that students should begin writing in

their journals) Okay, here we go! I see the pencils moving. I see those ideas rolling out. Roberto’s ready to roll. Keep it up, Marcus!

****Teacher**** 2: (Same setting) Not everyone has begun yet. Do you need me to **help** you think of a topic, Roberto? Marcus, I asked you not to stop. Let

me remind you, class, that this is not an optional activity. A student in the ﬁrst class seeking to do what’s normal will most likely take

part in the **lesson**. In the second class, her **attention** will be drawn to the litany of woes her teacher anxiously describes and to her off-task peers who seem to

be gaining converts. She will likely choose that path as well. Teach Like a Champion

Narrating your weakness only makes your weakness seem

normal. If you say, ‘‘Some students didn’t do what

I asked,’’ you have made that situation public. Now your

choice is consequence or countenance.

Perception, it turns out, is reality. Great teachers conjure Big Mo by nor-

malizing the positive. They draw atten- tion to the good and the getting better.

Narrating your weakness makes your weakness seem normal. If you say,

“Some students didn’t do what I asked,” you have made that situation public.

Now your choice is consequence or countenance. “Check yourself to make

sure you’ve done what I asked,” keeps Big Mo on your side. If you need to

follow up to address a student or give a consequence, ﬁne. Do it as privately as you can, not just to protect the scofﬂaw’s feelings but to keep Big Mo on

the move. Similarly, “I’ve got almost everybody now,” is better than, “I don’t have everybody,” or, “I’m still waiting on some of you.” You might as well say,

“I’m very weak and implore you not to hurt me.” Big Mo loves speed. Try to use commands that multitask. Replace, “Who

can tell us what 3 times 5 is? David? Everyone please track David,” with the much simpler and faster, “Who can tell us what 3 times 5 is? Track . . .

David.” .

5. Challenge! Kids love to be challenged, to prove they can do things, to compete, to win. So challenge them: exhort them to prove what they can do by

building competition into the day. Students can be challenged as individuals or, usually better, as groups, and those groups can compete in various ways:

• Against other groups within the class

• Against other groups outside the class (the other homeroom)

• Against an impersonal foe (the clock; the test, to prove they’re better than it;

their age—“that was acceptable work for seventh graders but I want to see if we can kick it up to eighth-grade quality”)

• Against an abstract standard (“I want to see whether you guys have what it

takes!”) Here are some examples:

• “You guys have been doing a great job this week. Let’s see if you can take

it up a notch.” Building Character and Trust 209

• “I love the tracking I see. I wonder what happens when I move back

here.” •

“Let’s see if we can get these papers out in twelve seconds. Ready?!” •

“Good is not good enough. I want to see perfect today!” •

“Ms. Austin said she didn’t think you guys could knock out your math tables louder than her class. And they’re sitting across the hall right now.

Let’s show ’em what we’ve got.” •

“Let’s see which row has this information down! We’ll use a little friendly wager: the row where everyone gets it correct the fastest can skip the ﬁrst

two problems on the homework set!” 6. Talk expectations and aspirations. Talk about who your students are

becoming and where you’re going. Frame praise in those terms. When your class looks great, tell them they look like “college scholars,” and you feel as if you’re

sitting in the room with future presidents, doctors, and artists. While it’s nice that you’re proud of them and it’s certainly wonderful to tell them that, the goal in

the end is not for them to please you but for them to leave you behind on a long journey toward a more distant and more important goal than making you happy.

It’s useful if your praise sets a goal larger than your own opinion. On a more microlevel, seek opportunities that reafﬁrm expectations around smaller details.

When you’re correcting, say, “In this class, we always track,” not, “Some people aren’t giving us their best SLANT.” Finish an activity by saying, “If you ﬁnish

early, check your work. Make sure you get 100 percent today.” Keep their eyes on the prize by constantly referring to it.

Keep positive by avoiding two things: •

Rhetorical questions. Don’t ask questions that you don’t want an answer to. Don’t pretend to ask a question when you aren’t. Don’t make a charade by

asking, “Would you like to join us, David?” Just say, “Thank you for joining us on the rug, David.”

• Contingencies. Don’t say, “I’ll wait,” unless you will. The point is that you

won’t. And in saying so, you give your students the power by making your actions contingent on theirs. “We [or I] need you with us” is much more pro-

ductive, positive, and strong. Teach Like a Champion

# See it in action: clip 19

# Positive framing

In clip 19 on the DVD, Janelle Austin of Rochester Prep demonstrates

Positive Framing. Notice how effectively she kicks off class by narrating the positive (‘‘Ooooo, look at all those hands’’) and then narrating it a second

time but mixing in a challenge (‘‘I love the track I’m seeing right now. I wonder what happens if I move around the room’’).

A few moments later, Austin again narrates the positive—‘‘I see hands up that are ready to read!’’—this time mixing in a some expectations and

aspirations by describing the motivation behind the hands (they want to read) to make it explicit to all students. Notice the response from her

students in terms of additional hands that go up. Later Austin again narrates the positive (‘‘I really like the enthusiasm

that I’m seeing. This column right here is really grabbing hold to it’’) this time combining elements of the previous two examples, making the mental

state behind a raised hand explicit (‘‘enthusiasm’’) and throwing down an implicit challenge to the rest of the class by identifying a group that’s

particularly strong (‘‘This column right here’’). This clips shows perhaps a dozen examples of Positive Framing; see how

many you can ﬁnd. This clip is a montage of short moments from Janelle’s class over about a half-hour, edited so they appear in rapid proximity. The

clip therefore concentrates the amount of Positive Framing Austin does. This is important because too much of a good thing can cheapen it. As

she shows, it’s often best to sprinkle it in regularly but in small amounts throughout a **lesson**, to use a cooking analogy, rather than dumping in a

quart of it all at once. Think: ‘‘Salt to taste.’’ Tracking refers to students following the speaker with their eyes. See

technique 32, SLANT, in Chapter Five. .

# Technique 44

# Precise praise

Positive reinforcement is one of the most powerful tools in every classroom. Most

experts say it should happen three times as often as criticism and correction. How- ever, any powerful tool can be used poorly or for naught. Poorly implemented

Building Character and Trust 211 positive reinforcement is no exception. In using positive reinforcement, follow

these rules of thumb for Positive Praise: • Differentiate acknowledgment and praise. Champion teachers make a

careful and intentional distinction between praise and acknowledgment, acknowl- edging when expectations have been met and praising when the exceptional

has been achieved. Kids who meet expectations deserve to have it noticed and acknowledged as frequently as possible. In a case where expectations have been

met and acknowledgment is ﬁtting, a simple description of what the student did or even a thank-you usually sufﬁces: “You were ready for class right on

time, John.” “You did it just the way I asked, Shayna. Thank you.” Kids who do something truly exceptional also deserve to be told that what they did was

above and beyond—that is, to be praised. Praising usually carries a judgment in addition to a mere description: “Fantastic work, John!” “Shayna’s really

done something amazing!” However, mixing these two responses by praising students for doing what is expected is, in the long run, not just ineffective

but destructive. Consider this statement: “Great job bringing a pencil to class today, John!” Why, in the eyes of the rest of the class, is John being praised

for doing what they’ve been doing all along? Are the rules different for John because he hasn’t been bringing his pencil? Has John really been “great,” as the

teacher said? There are two possible answers to this last question, and neither is especially

good. The ﬁrst is, no: the teacher does not sincerely think it’s a great thing that John brought his pencil to class. She’s just trying to be enthusiastic, positive, and

encouraging. But the more enthusiasm she packs into her voice in praising John, the more she shows that her words are disingenuous. Her praise, she shows,

is empty and cheap. Who wants to be great if that’s all it takes? In fact, the culturewide misuse of praise has a documented perverse effect. Recent research

demonstrates that students have come to interpret frequent praise as a sign that they are doing poorly and need encouragement from their teacher. They see

cheap praise as a marker of failure, not success. And often they are right to do so. Since genuine praise is critically important, teachers should carefully

avoid setting themselves up for such an inversion of meaning and save praise for what exceeds expectation.

The second possible answer is yes: some part of the teacher genuinely thinks it’s “great” that John brought his pencil. She is pleasantly surprised. This potential

reading of her words also creates a perverse effect: if the teacher is surprised that John did what she asked, her expectations are not real. She doesn’t truly

“expect” them to happen. She is surprised when students do what she’s asked, or Teach Like a Champion

she knows that her difﬁcult students won’t really be able to do what she expects of the rest of the class. A translation of what she is thinking is, “In my heart,

I expect you not to do what I ask much or most of the time. In my heart, I don’t really think I can get all kids to do what they need to do.”

In the long run, a teacher who continually praises what’s

expected risks trivializing both the praise and the things she

really wishes to label ‘‘great.’’ In the long run, a teacher who con-

tinually praises what’s expected risks trivializing both the praise and the things

she really wishes to label “great.” Erod- ing her ability to give meaningful verbal

rewards and to identify behavior that is truly worthy of notice is a dangerous

practice for a teacher. In an acknowledgment, the teacher describes what a student has done, often

in an approving tone and often with explicit thanks. In praise, he or she puts an exemplary value judgment on it. This does not mean that acknowledgment has

to be bland or dull. In the case of John and his pencil, champion teachers of various stripes might use a mix of enthusiastic acknowledgments for example,

“Johnny B.! Got his tools and coming to work today!” .

• Praise (and acknowledge) loud; ﬁx soft. Whispered or even nonverbal criticism or reminders assume the best about students: they allow them to self-

correct without being called out in public. This is also to the teacher’s beneﬁt, even when behavior is clearly deﬁant, as it keeps the student offstage as much

as possible and makes the teacher appear to be in control. Good news, however, is good news: make it as public as possible. A student who exceeds expectations

demonstrates the art of the possible. That’s something that all students should attend to, and as the section on narrating the positive in Positive Framing demon-

strates, consistently making students who meet expectations visible normalizes it and makes it more likely to happen.

Research into praise has shown a big difference between praising a student for being smart and praising a student for working hard. The latter is a behavior

easily and readily within the student’s control. This student knows that he has intentionally done something worthy and can do it again. Such praise fosters

effort and positive risk taking. Praising a trait has the opposite effect: students called smart were not only being praised for something they couldn’t reliably

replicate, but they took fewer risks as a result, since they were afraid of appearing less smart. So praise as speciﬁcally as possible and focus on exactly the behavior

and action that you would like to see more of. Building Character and Trust 213

• Praise must be genuine. Early on in school, students listen for and discount insincere praise. In fact, Stanford social psychologist Carol Dweck has

shown in her book Mindset: The New Psychology of Success that students often read praise as an indication that their work is inferior, which suggests an epidemic

of insincere praise that should be rectiﬁed. The most common forms of insincere praise are those designed to artiﬁcially bolster self-esteem and those designed

in **interaction** with a student to ﬁx a systematic problem in the teacher’s span of control. Her conversation with a child is about that child’s behavior, not the

behavior of the child next to him. Telling a child, “Nice job getting ready, Bill,” is ﬁne thing. But if a teacher resorts to praising Bill in order to tell Sally, next

to him, to put a move on (that is, to correct her instead of to subtly encourage her by showing that Bill has earned genuine acknowledgment), she undercuts the

integrity and veracity of her praise. Setting Bill up to do your work with Sally risks jeopardizing the effective relationship you have. And it does not solve your

situation with Sally.

# Technique 45

# Warm/strict

We’re socialized to believe that warmth and strictness are opposites: if you’re

more of one, it means being less of the other. I don’t know where this false conception comes from, but if you choose to believe in it, it will undercut your

teaching. The fact is that the degree to which you are warm has no bearing on the degree to which you are strict, and vice versa. Just as you can be neither warm nor

strict (you may teach the children of parents who are this way and see for yourself the cost), you can also be warm and strict. In fact, as this Warm/Strict technique

shows, you must be both: caring, funny, warm, concerned, and nurturing—and also strict, by the book, relentless, and sometimes inﬂexible. It’s not, “I care about

you, but you still must serve the consequence for being late,” but, “Because I care about you, you must serve the consequence for being late.”

In fact, the Warm/Strict paradox—the fact that what we think of as opposites are in fact unrelated—runs deeper. Not only should you seek to be both; you

should often seek to be both at exactly the same time. When you are clear, consis- tent, ﬁrm, and unrelenting and at the same time positive, enthusiastic, caring, and

thoughtful, you start to send the message to students that having high expectations is part of caring for and respecting someone. This is a very powerful message.

Teach Like a Champion You can make your Warm/Strict especially effective in these ways:

• Explain to students why you’re doing what you are (see Explain Everything,

technique 48 later in this chapter) and how it is designed to **help** them: “Priya, we don’t do that in this classroom because it keeps us from making the most of

our learning time. I’m going to have to try to **help** you remember that.” •

Distinguish between behavior and people. Say, “Your behavior is inconsider- ate,” rather than, “You’re inconsiderate.”

• Demonstrate that consequences are temporary. Show a student that when he

has dealt with the consequences of a mistake, it is immediately in the past. Smile and greet him naturally to show that he is starting over with a clean

slate. Tell a student, regarding her consequence, “After you’re done, I can’t wait to have you come back and show us your best.” Once you’ve given a con-

sequence, your next job is to forgive. Remember that you use a consequence so you won’t have to hold the grudge. Get over it quickly.

• Use warm, nonverbal behavior. Put your arm on a student’s shoulder and

kindly tell him you’re sorry but he’ll have to redo the homework. You just know he’s capable of better. Bend down to a third grader’s eye level, and

explain to her ﬁrmly that she won’t be allowed to talk to her classmates that way.

In balanced combination and proportions, warm (being positive, enthusiastic, caring, and thoughtful) and strict (being clear, consistent, ﬁrm, and unrelenting)

together can even **help** students internalize apparent contradictions and overcome what Jim Collins rightly called, in his seminal book Built to Last, “the tyranny

of the ‘or.’” It reminds students that many of the either-or choices in their lives are false constructs: “I can be hip and successful; I can have fun and work hard;

I can be happy and say no to self-indulgence.”

primary ways that hard work gets done.

out that ﬁnding joy in the work of learning—the J-Factor—is a key driver

not just of a happy classroom but of a high-achieving classroom. It’s use-

ful, if not exactly a revelation, that people work harder when they enjoy

working on something—not perhaps in every minute of every day, but when

their work is punctuated regularly by moments of exultation and joy. The

joy can take a surprisingly wide array of forms given the diversity of teach-

ers who employ it and the diversity of moments in which they use it. J-Factor moments can, but need not, involve

singing or dancing. Joy exists for students in all the forms it exists for adults: loud or quiet; individual, small group, or large group oriented. The common

theme is for teachers to ﬁnd a way to let their own genuine version of joy shine through. For some, quiet passion is the most common form; for some its humor;

for others high-energy antics. Here are ﬁve categories of J-Factor activities that champion teachers use in

their classrooms: • Fun and games. These activities draw on kids’ love for challenges,

competition, and play. Examples include having students compete to see who can “roll their numbers” (do repeated addition) the fastest or who can put the

midwestern states in alphabetical order by last letter the fastest. Bees (spelling, geography, math), **content**-based around-the-worlds, relay races, and jeopardies

also count here. At one school, students play their teachers in math baseball: to hit a single, you have to solve the problem faster than the teacher who’s covering

ﬁrst base. • Us (and them). Kids, like everybody else, take pleasure in belonging

to things. One of the key functions of cultures—those in the classroom and more broadly—is to make members feel they belong to an important “us,” a

vibrant and recognizable entity that only some people get to be part of. Through unique language, names, rituals, traditions, songs, and the like, cultures establish

“us”-ness. In many cases, the more inscrutable these rituals are to outsiders, the better. The inscrutability reinforces the presence of the “them” that’s necessary

to any “us.” Champion teachers who use these activities develop markers to Teach Like a Champion

remind students that they are insiders in a vibrant culture. At Rochester Prep, for example, history teacher David McBride came up with nicknames for all of

his students and used them to call on students in class or to greet them in the hallways. Being greeted with, “Mornin’, T-bone!” feels more special than

being greeted with, “Good morning, Taylor.” After all, the people who make up nicknames for you are the people who care about you most.

If you’ve ever watched Chris Berman dish out his hilarious nicknames for athletes on ESPN’s Sportscenter (Greg “Crocodile” Brock; Vincent “Ultimate”

Brisby; Barry “Bananas” Foster), you get the gist of what McBride did, and you also know how fun and funny such a game can be. When you watch Berman, you

listen for the nicknames because you’re in on the gag. “Is that guy’s nickname really ‘Personal?!’ ” If you have to ask, you’re not “us.”

Developing secret signals and special words is related to this. Teachers hum a secret song—for example, “We’re All in This Together”—without the words.

The subtext is: This is our song; we all know the words and why we’re singing it; no one on the outside needs to (or can) understand this. We are an “us.” Some

classrooms even have development myths: shared stories provided by the teacher to prove a point or teach a **lesson**, for example, a story about “my cousin Martha,

who gives up when the going gets tough” gets referenced before each test: “Don’t go pulling a Martha here.”

• Drama, song, and dance. Music, dramatic play, and movement raise spirits and also establish collective identity. This is why they exist within

every identiﬁable ethnic or national culture on earth. The spirit lifting is all the more potent among the youthful, especially those who are chair bound. Acting

things out and singing about them can be an exceptional way to remember information.

Drama, song, and dance also power-up memory. My seventh-grade Spanish teacher taught us a hokey Spanish version of “Jingle Bells.” Much though

I would like to forget it or keep it from occasionally rattling through my sub- conscious, I cannot. I occasionally cannot remember my own phone number,

but I will always have her Spanish version of “Jingle Bells.” To learn a song about something—especially one that’s a tad absurd or unusual or one you sing

regularly—is, for many, to know it for life. The upside of the burden my seventh- grade Spanish teacher left me is that the power of song or dance can be harnessed

to instill and reinforce any speciﬁc knowledge or belief. Imagine if I had a song rattling through my head telling me when to use ser and estar, the two forms of

the Spanish verb “to be,” instead of “Jingle Bells.” My Spanish would be forever Building Character and Trust 217

improved (not to mention various awkward moments in my life avoided). To sing is to remember.

• Humor. Laughter is one of the base conditions of happiness and fulﬁllment, which makes it a powerful tool to building an **environment** of happy

and fulﬁlled students and teachers. A tool this powerful should be used, though I can’t give you much of a recipe, only an example or two.

One champion teacher taught his kids a song for dozens of formulas in sixth-grade math. After they had made a habit of learning these, he told them

he was working on a song to **help** them determine the circumference of a circle, but that what he had so far was too uncool to use. He sung a quick snippet

of what he was working on: “2r, my Lord” to the tune of “Kumbaya.” His kids laughed, and he admonished them: “Don’t tell anyone about that. There

is no song for circumference. Is there a song for circumference? No, we’ve got no song for that!” Whenever studying circumference, he would ask the class:

“Remind me, do we have a song for circumference?” After the class resoundingly answered, “No!” he would hum “Kumbaya” to himself, making a reliably funny

inside joke that made it all but impossible not to remember the formula for circumference.

• Suspense and surprise. Routines are powerful drivers of efﬁciency and predictability. They also make occasional variations all the more fun, silly, sur-

prising, and inspiring. If harnessed judiciously, the unexpected can be powerful. The two together make the classroom an adventure, no matter what the **content**.

An art teacher I know takes the samples she ordinarily shows her class—a landscape, a still life, a traditional carving—and puts them in a wrapped box like

a present. She begins her **lesson** by saying, “I’ve got something in the mystery box that’s really cool and exciting. I can’t wait to show you because it’s an example

of what we’re talking about today.” Several times during a typical mini-**lesson**, she’ll build the anticipation by walking over to the box and then “deciding” to

wait, or by peeking in and hamming up her reaction: “Ouch, it bit me!” By the time she shows the kids what’s in the box, they can hardly wait to see it. A math

teacher does something similar with his number rolling songs: “Oh, man, you’re gonna love the last verse. It’s really funny. And if we keep working, we’ll get

to hear it soon.” A third-grade teacher occasionally hands out her vocabulary words in sealed

envelopes, one to each child. “Don’t open them yet,” she’ll whisper, “not until I say.” And by the time she does, there’s little in the world each of those would

trade for the opportunity to see what their word is. Teach Like a Champion

# Joy factor

In clip 20 on the DVD, George Davis of Leadership Prep Bedford Stuyvesant

demonstrates Joy Factor. This clip provides a great example of making the work fun, as opposed to making fun the antidote to the work. His kids are

getting lots of at bats while they play their game. Look for elements of all ﬁve kinds of joy in this clip.

J-Factor is similar to Vegas (technique 27), so people often ask what the difference is. Actually there are two differences. The ﬁrst is that Vegas is an

instructional tool, explicitly reinforcing the **lesson** objective and drawing the chil- dren into the **content**. Second, although most, if not all, of Vegas is also J-Factor,

the latter is a larger category and includes classroom elements devised speciﬁ- cally to build and include kids in the room’s culture. For example, giving students

nicknames doesn’t reinforce academics, so it’s not Vegas, but it does make them feel a happy sense of belonging. In that sense it’s a J-Factor technique. Singing

the nonsong for determining the circumference of a circle is both.

# Joy factor and tight transitions

In clip 21 on the DVD, Sultana Noormuhammad of Leadership Prep Bedford

Stuyvesant demonstrates Joy Factor. It’s not just the happiness brought about as kids sing their transition to the carpet that’s so remarkable, but

the fact that the song, the Homeroom Indiana ‘‘Fight Song,’’ reinforces productive student behaviors. Moreover, Noormuhammad is able to turn

it on and turn it off. As soon as the children are settled on the carpet, the room is pin-drop quiet, and Homeroom Indiana is ready to get to work.

As I hope is obvious, this clip is also a great example of Tight Transitions (technique 30).

# Technique 47

# Emotional constancy

Here are two things to do with your emotions. First, modulate them. ****School****

is a laboratory for students; they need to be able to ﬁgure out how to behave without seeing you explode. You should expect almost anything, so act as if

you expect it and have a plan to deal with it. Second, tie your emotions to student achievement, not to your own moods or the emotions of the students

you teach. Again, expect their emotions to rise and fall, and be sure to con- trol your own to compensate. Expect students to occasionally get upset, and

respond calmly. Part of adolescence is experimenting with exaggerated emo- tions. Don’t add gas to the ﬁre by letting your own become inﬂamed, and

hold no grudges, but view the aftermath of a consequence to be a fresh start. After all, the point of a consequence is to create a sufﬁcient disincentive: if

the disincentive is sufﬁcient, it has done its job and the cycle is over; if the consequence was inefﬁcient, address the use of consequences rather than get

angry. Success is in the long run

about a student’s consistent relationship with productive

behaviors. Teachers

with Emotional

Con- stancy tread cautiously around much of

the language that other teachers use as a habit, thinking carefully about what they

imply the goal of student decisions to be. For example, many teachers say things

like, “I’m really disappointed in you,” when their class has behaved poorly. However, it’s worth asking whether the

point of the rule or expectation has been to please the teacher. There may be times when the teacher’s personal sense of connection and approval is some-

thing students should be concerned about, but they are far rarer than teachers’ language would indicate. Merely substituting, “I expect better of you,” or, “The

expectation in this class is that you give your best,” takes that teacher’s per- sonal emotions out of the equation and focuses the conversation on what kids

did or didn’t do rather than what the teacher felt. The latter factor is, in the end, almost irrelevant.

An emotionally constant teacher earns students’ trust in part by having them know he is always under control. Most of all, he knows success is in the long run

about a student’s consistent relationship with productive behaviors. The affect he requires is productive, respectful, and orderly, and his goal when emotions

Teach Like a Champion run hot is to deescalate. In so doing, he not only circumscribes the sorts of

conﬂicts that can consume a classroom but provides an emotional rudder to **help** his students return to productivity as soon as possible.

# Technique 48

# Explain everything

Students in a high-performing classroom understand the dynamics of personal

and group accountability. They know the logic behind the rules and expecta- tions designed for their betterment; they understand that group success depends

on everyone’s participation. They get these aspects of the big picture because their teachers deliberately make their expectations clear, rational, and logical.

They constantly remind students why they do what they do and ground their explanations in the mission: this will **help** you get to college; this will **help** you

understand how to be responsible. If there’s a pace that needs to be maintained in order to achieve the day’s objective, the Explain Everything teacher tells

her students, “I’d love to spend more time talking about this, but there’s a lot we’ve got to do.” She couches conversations about misbehavior in language

that explains to students why it matters and how one action or behavior affects another. In this way, students understand the logic behind decision making and

will be more likely to both believe that the systems are in their best interests and make rational choices on their own.

Consider how this looks on a typical day in Darryl Williams’s classroom. A third grader asks whether he can go to the nurse. Before answering, Williams

asks the student to consider the logic of the situation, saying, “Do you understand that if you go to the nurse, you’re not going to participate when we have recess?”

The student acknowledges that his decision will affect the rest of his day. If he is too sick to learn, then he is obviously too sick to play. Williams grants him

permission to go to the nurse. Later, when hands are eagerly in the air, perhaps a little too eagerly, Williams says, “Please put your hands down. I know that you

all have questions, and I love it when you say intelligent things, but we have a lot to do, and right now there’s not time. We still need to read our story and

do workshop.” In a classroom like this, the rationale behind decisions made in students’ interest and the way that adults think on behalf of children is suddenly

made clear. Building Character and Trust 221

There’s at least one particular subtlety to the narrating of the why’s of the classroom that bears deeper analysis here. My colleagues and I discovered this

while watching a video of a **lesson** in which the teacher appeared to be explaining everything but not particularly successfully. The issue, we discovered, was that

she was explaining why she was doing things as she was striving, with mixed success, to get control of the room: “Remember that when I call on one student

to answer, we’re all looking and listening. [Sternly] Charles, we’re all looking and listening because we’re learning from our friends, even if it’s not our turn.”

Her last phrase reminded students that the class was not successfully meeting expectations and that the teacher was not explaining why they did what they did

but trying to get them to do it in the ﬁrst place. Her explanations sounded too much like pleading. Effective Explain Everything, it struck us, happens either

in a calm moment well in advance of behavior that needs ﬁxing (“When I ask for your **attention**, I’m going to expect it from every one of you every time.

That way I can be sure you know everything you need to know to be successful and happy in my class!”) or else after “ﬁxing” has resulted in the meeting of

expectations: “Thank you. The reason I need you to be all the way silent like that is . . .”

# Technique 49

# Normalize error

Error followed by correction and **instruction** is the fundamental process of school-

ing. You get it wrong, and then you get it right. If getting it wrong and then getting it right is normal, teachers should Normalize Error and respond to both

parts of this sequence as if they were totally and completely normal. After all, they are.

# Wrong answers: don’t chasten; don’t excuse

Avoid chastening wrong answers, for example, “No, we already talked about

this. You have to ﬂip the sign, Ruben.” And do not make excuses for students who get answers wrong: “Oh, that’s okay, Charlise. That was a really hard one.”

In fact, if wrong answers are truly a normal and healthy part of the learning process, they don’t need much narration at all.

Teach Like a Champion

# Key idea

# Normalize error

Getting it wrong and then getting it right is one of the

fundamental processes for schooling. Respond to both parts of this sequence, the wrong and the right, as completely

normal. It’s better, in fact, to avoid spending a lot of time talking about wrongness

and get down to the work of ﬁxing it as quickly as possible. Although many teachers feel obligated to name every answer as right or wrong, spending time

making that judgment is usually a step you can skip entirely before getting to work. For example, you could respond to a wrong answer by a student named

Noah by saying, “Let’s try that again, Noah. What’s the ﬁrst thing we have to do?” or even, “What’s the ﬁrst thing we have to do in solving this **kind**

of problem, Noah?” This second situation is particularly interesting because it remains ambiguous to Noah and his classmates whether the answer was right or

wrong as they start reworking the problem. There’s a bit of suspense, and they will have to ﬁgure it out for themselves. When and if you do name an answer as

wrong, do so quickly and simply (“not quite”) and keep moving. Again, since getting it wrong is normal, you don’t have to feel badly about it. In fact, if all

students are getting all questions right, the work you’re giving them isn’t hard enough.

# Right answers: don’t flatter; don’t fuss

Praising right answers can have one of two perverse effects on students. If you

make too much of fuss, you suggest to students—unless it’s patently obvious that an answer really is exceptional—that you’re surprised that they got the

answer right. And as a variety of social science research has recently documented, praising students for being “smart” perversely incents them not to take risks

(apparently they worry about no longer looking smart if they get things wrong), in contrast to praising students for working hard, which incents them to take

risks and take on challenges. Building Character and Trust 223

Thus, in most cases when a student gets an answer correct, acknowledge that the student has done the work correctly or has worked hard; then move on:

“That’s right, Noah. Nice work.” Champion teachers show their students they expect both right and wrong to happen by not making too big a deal of either. Of

course, there will be times when you want to sprinkle in stronger praise (“Such an insightful answer, Carla. Awesome”). Just do so carefully so that such praise

isn’t diluted by overuse.

# Reflection and practice

The following statements are negatively framed. Try rewriting them to make them positively framed.

• ‘‘We’re not going to have another day like yesterday, are

we, Jason? •

‘‘Just a minute, Jane. Absolutely no one is giving you their full **attention** except Dyonte and Beth.’’

• ‘‘I need the tapping to stop.’’

• ‘‘I’ve asked you twice to stop slouching, Jasmine!’’

2. Consider what speciﬁc behavioral traits (hard work, respect for

peers, for example) you most want students to demonstrate in your classroom. For each, write three or four scripts you might use to

reinforce them using Precise Praise. 3.

Make a list of the situations in which you are most vulnerable to losing your emotional constancy. Script a calm and poised comment

you might make to the other people involved that also reminds you to remain constant.

# Improving your Pacing

Additional Techniques for Creating a

Positive Rhythm in the ****Classroom**** Pacing is a term most teachers are familiar with, but it lacks a clear and consistent

deﬁnition. The obvious deﬁnition, that pacing is the speed at which you teach, doesn’t hold up to scrutiny. Most teachers recognize a discrepancy between the

actual rate at which teaching happens and the rate at which students perceive it to be happening. You can appear to race through a **lesson** in adding fractions with

like denominators, for example, when ironically you are stretching the time you spend on the skill to ensure mastery. You double the time you actually spend on

an objective but take certain steps to make it feel as if you were moving twice as quickly. Or you could spend insufﬁcient time on an objective and thus go too

fast in the academic sense, and at the same time your **lesson** could seem deathly slow and tedious to students. So pacing is clearly different from the rate at which

you move through material. An alternative way of deﬁning pacing is “the illusion of speed.” It isn’t the

rate at which material is presented, but rather the rate at which the **lesson** makes that material appear to unfold. Pacing is the skill of creating the perception that

you are moving quickly. Or maybe better, since effective teaching can use a range of tempos from slow, steady reﬂection to bracing, energetic speed, pacing is the

illusion of speed created as and when necessary. Students like to think they’re doing something new more frequently than you can afford to change the topic of

Teach Like a Champion their learning, and pacing taps into that desire. When you’re maximizing pacing,

your teaching engages and interests students, giving them a sense of progress and change. Things are happening: students feel the progress and never know

what’s next. Regardless of how fast you’re

actually ﬂying, passengers’ perception of how fast they’re

moving is inﬂuenced by the reference points they see (or

don’t see) passing. A vignette from life outside the

classroom might **help** to clarify the point. When my son was ﬁve, we ﬂew to

visit my parents. As the jet touched down, he asked me whether the plane

ﬂew faster when it was landing. He thought we had sped up at exactly the

time we had slowed down. I asked him why he thought so. “When we’re land-

ing,” he said, “I can see the buildings and the trees going by. I see that they’re going past us fast, and I know that

we’re going fast too.” This is a good analogy for pacing. Regardless of how fast you’re actually ﬂying, passengers’ perception of how fast they’re moving is inﬂu-

enced by the reference points they see (or don’t see) passing. In the classroom, moments in which the activity shifts, a task is completed, or a new person enters

the conversation can serve as reference points. When reference points appear to pass in rapid succession, they can make it seem like things are moving fast,

regardless of your actual speed. This chapter offers six techniques for managing the illusion of speed in your

classroom.

# Change the pace

One way to create the illusion of speed is by using a variety of activities to

accomplish your objective and moving from one to the other throughout the course of a **lesson**—that is, to use Change the Pace. It’s worth thinking about

the difference between changing topics every ten to ﬁfteen minutes for an hour, which is distracting, confusing, and unproductive, and changing the format of

the work every ten to ﬁfteen minutes as you seek to master a single topic. The latter is likely to improve your pacing, the former to distract and confuse

students. Spending ten minutes on topic sentences, ﬁfteen minutes on subject- verb agreement, and ﬁfteen minutes on copyediting yields an unfocused **lesson**.

Improving Your Pacing 227 But a **lesson** on topic sentences might be both focused and fast-paced in this

way: •

Start with a quick Do Now asking students to compare different topic sen- tences for a paragraph on an interesting topic.

• Move directly into a mini-**lesson** in which you deﬁne topic sentence and pro-

vide positive and negative examples. •

Teach a short song about the criteria for a good topic sentence. •

Guide students through three or four examples where they write an effective topic sentence for a given paragraph.

• Have your class write topic sentences for each paragraph in a humorous mem-

oir you’ve written, analyzing the various suggestions for each, marking them up, and improving them.

• Move to independent work of drafting topic sentences for a set of widely vary-

ing paragraphs. •

Wrap with a quick review of your topic sentence song. •

Cap with an Exit Ticket. “Nothing for more than ten minutes,” advises Ryan Hill, principal of the

highly successful TEAM Academy in Newark. I’d asked for guidance on pacing from some colleagues, and he pointed me to brain research suggesting that people

of all ages tend to begin losing focus after ten minutes and need something new to engage them.

My colleague Chi Tschang of Achievement First has taken this idea a step further, advising teachers to switch activities within the **lesson** based on the Age

Plus Two Rule, a concept I’ve seen attributed to various original sources. The rule states that a student’s optimal **attention** span equals his or her age plus two,

which means that in the case of ﬁfth graders, his rule of thumb isn’t far from Ryan Hill’s. However, Chi believes that even if you change activities in a **lesson**

at the right rate, things can still go wrong. He thinks of **lesson** activities as active or passive, and says activities should ﬂuctuate between these two types:

“If there are two (or three) highly active kinesthetic activities in a row,” he writes, “the class’s energy level can shoot off the charts, and kids can lose focus.

Alternatively, if there are two (or three) highly passive activities in a row, the class can lose its energy entirely and also lose its focus.”

Teach Like a Champion Change the Pace carries with it a powerful potential to energize the class-

room, yet I can’t leave the discussion without sharing one caveat. While Change the Pace is useful for engaging students in many lessons at many points in their

academic careers, it also risks exacerbating a problem to address: the shortness of **attention** spans. Think of the professions that require more sustained bouts of

focused, disciplined **attention** than age plus 2: doctor, lawyer, airline pilot, and engineer spring to mind. Even if research proves them to exist, short **attention**

spans are just as likely to be the product of environmental factors, some of which we can mitigate. I suspect that people in the seventeenth century did not need

or crave intellectual change at the same median rate we do today, which means teachers can both recognize the usefulness of responding to limited **attention**

spans and seek to gradually and persistently extend them. One of the greatest gifts a school can give a student is to increase his or her capacity to concentrate

for extended periods of time. That said, the most successful way to do that is clearly not to immerse your students in an hour of sustained note taking on the

ﬁrst day of school.

# Brighten lines

Every time you start an activity in a **lesson**, you’re presented with an oppor-

tunity to Brighten Lines: to draw bright, clear lines at the beginning and end. Making activities begin and end crisply and clearly rather than melding together

in an undifferentiated stew can have a positive effect on pacing. Beginnings and endings that are more visible to participants are more likely to be perceived as

reference points and create the perception that you’ve done multiple discrete things. It makes the reference points you create more distinct and visible. Draw-

ing a bright line can also improve pacing because the ﬁrst and last minute of any activity play a large role in shaping students’ perceptions of them. Get your

activities off to a clean start, and students will perceive them to be energetic and dynamic.

A clean start is not always a fast start, however. It can be, and in fact a fast start is often fun and engaging, and moving quickly is one great way to create

the illusion of speed. But you can also create the illusion of speed by adapting the language you use to introduce a quiet reﬂective activity from, “Take some time

to answer the questions in front of you. Then we’ll begin discussing the novel,” to, “Take exactly three minutes to answer the questions in front of you. Then

we’ll begin discussing the novel.” Bounding each activity with ﬁnite time limits Improving Your Pacing 229

makes it appear to be more autonomous and makes its end point clear, and using odd increments of time—three minutes rather than ﬁve—draws students’ atten-

tion to the fact that you are not meandering through time with vague estimates but actively managing each minute. You could make the transition even sharper

and more visible by giving a start signal, upgrading with: “Take three minutes to answer the questions in front of you. Then we’ll begin discussing the novel.

Ready? Go!” Now your activity has a clear start time and a speciﬁc duration. Stu- dents can see others hop to it on cue, as if they were at the starting line of a race.

You can use a variation of this as students complete their work: telling them they’re done can **help** make another bright, clear line. You might adapt the

previous scenario, for example, by saying, “When I clap my hands three times, I’ll want to see hands of those of you who want to share your answer to the ﬁrst

question.” The claps emphasize that something has ended and something else quickly begun. This line can be drawn for individuals—“You’re done, Trevor.

You can start in on the reading”—or for groups—“Well done, ﬁfth grade. Three stomps on two, and we’re on to the next step.” Finally, looking forward makes

these transitions especially exciting. Telling Trevor or the ﬁfth grade, “Here we go!” makes a sense of excitement and anticipation pervade.

# All hands

You can also create the illusion of speed by shifting rapidly among and involving

a wide array of participants by using All Hands. This can be especially helpful when you aren’t able to shift activities in your **lesson** as in Change the Pace,

which you won’t always be able to do. Let’s say you are reading and discussing an extensive passage for much of a class period. Having multiple students read short

segments from the passage and moving rapidly among them would create a sense of speed. Each time you shift among participants, you establish a reference point.

Something has changed—something begun and ended—and a bit of suspense is created (Who will go next?). Using All Hands can **help** you react to and energize

a lagging class quickly and simply. To maximize your ability to use All Hands, several other skills and techniques

may prove useful, especially Cold Call (technique 22), Pepper (technique 24), “Unbundle” and “Half-Statement” from Ratio (technique 17), and Control the

Game (Chapter Ten). Cold Call and Pepper allow you to call on everybody, which means more people feel part of the action. They also allow you to call on

participants more quickly and with less linguistic mucking around. There is no Teach Like a Champion

asking who would like to add to that, no awkwardly coddling folks to raise their hands. You just say a name and get started. “Unbundle” allows you to parse a

potentially broad question out to more students and in smaller, and thus faster, increments. You take a slow answer from one student and make it three quick

answers from three students from the far corners of the room. Half-statements allow you to involve all students quickly using Call and ****Response**** but at very

low transaction cost. Control the Game also builds pacing. One barrier to pacing is the long-winded and meandering student com-

ment offered at the wrong time. You can use All Hands to address this chal- lenge by socializing students to give succinct answers, using an upbeat stock

phrase—“Hold it!” “Time out!” “Pause!” or “Freeze,” for example—to make a quick interruption when appropriate, reminding students of the question and

diverting it to another student. You can follow up with a reminder to focus on the question, answer in two sentences, or “save that thought for later” if useful.

If you do this consistently, students will intuit the pacing expectations in your classroom and respond accordingly.

A ﬁnal piece of All Hands is managing questions, requests, and comments that are either off task (“Are we going to be writing in our journals later?”) or

persist on a topic you are ready to dispense with (“I wanted to read what I wrote about Tabitha, too”). Such benign distractions can pose a serious threat to pacing,

and even hands raised to ask questions can waste time and disrupt the energy and timing of an otherwise perfect class. The best teachers seem to be especially

attentive to this, using a version of the “Do Not Engage” portion of Strong Voice (technique 38) and telling students “No hands right now,” or something similar

when the time is not right.

# Every minute matters

Time is water in the desert, a teacher’s most precious resource: to be husbanded,

guarded, and conserved. Every minute matters. And yet in a variety of situations, we risk letting the minutes slip by. The last few minutes of class, for example, are

sometimes blithely given away. We say, “We don’t have time to start anything new,” or “We worked hard, so I’m giving you guys a few minutes to relax.”

Let’s say this **kind** of thinking applies to just the last four minutes of class. That adds up to roughly twelve and a half hours of “last few minutes” during each

of perhaps six classes in each school year. If you did that every day, you’d give away seventy-ﬁve hours of **instruction**—several weeks of school.

Improving Your Pacing 231 Instead, use Every Minute Matters and reward students for their hard work

with a high-energy review of all they’ve learned or with a challenge problem. Keep a series of short learning activities ready so you’re prepared when a two-

minute opportunity emerges: at the end of class, in the hallway, while waiting for buses. A walk to the bathroom is a perfect time for a vocabulary review.

Packing up backpacks at the end of the day is a great opportunity for reading aloud to the students from an inspiring novel. There’s no better way to keep

kids from getting off task while lining up for lunch than by peppering them with multiplication problems and mental math. Getting out to the bus to go home?

Have every student think of an adjective to describe the bus. You can always be teaching.

There are roughly twelve and a half-hours of “last few minutes” during each of perhaps six classes in each school year.

Every few months I reinspire myself by watching a short video of Jamey Verilli managing his minutes one afternoon at North Star Academy. Waiting with

most of his students outside a history classroom for the last few students to arrive, he begins quizzing students on their vocabulary words:

• “What does it mean to be ‘bound’ to do something?”

• “Can you use it in a sentence, John?”

• “Who would have been bound to the land in a Middle Ages town?”

• “What are you bound to be doing right now?”

The students are standing in a line in the hallway just outside his classroom. Class has not even started yet. Not in the classroom, not during class time and

Jamey doesn’t care: there’s learning to be done. Meanwhile his students are excited, smiling, happy to engaged and showing off their knowledge.

# Look forward

Even mild suspense creates tension, excitement, and anticipation. You can harvest

that in your classroom to make your pacing feel more vibrant by using Look Forward. If you put an agenda on the board for a **lesson** or the morning, you can

start students looking forward. If you add a catchy name to some of the topics on your agenda, they seem all the more intriguing. If you call one “Mystery

Activity,” you can make the anticipation even more intense. You can go further Teach Like a Champion

by referring to it occasionally: “We’re almost there. Charles thinks he knows what it is but . . . oh, no. He has no idea.”

Bob Zimmerli once entranced a class of ﬁfth graders during a **lesson** on place value by writing a number with twelve digits on the board and announcing, “At

the end of class today, somebody’s going to stand up and read this number correctly to the class. Everyone’s going to be able to, but one of you is going to

get to represent! You’re going to march up here and show us how. Be ready. It might be you.” Here are a few other ways to refer to the future:

• “Later we’ll be making this really tricky, so stay with me now, even if it

seems easy [or hard].” •

“By the end of class you’ll be able to [or you’ll know the true story behind] . . . ”

• “This is the ﬁrst step in a skill that you’ll want to show off to all your friends.”

There are simpler ways to look forward. Consider the difference in the example we looked at in Brighten Lines in this chapter. While, “Take exactly

three minutes to answer the questions in front of you. Then we’ll begin dis- cussing the novel,” is better than, “Take some time to answer the questions

in front of you. Then we’ll begin discussing the novel,” both are better than, “Take some time to answer the questions in front of you,” with no reference

to what’s next. After hearing the ﬁrst version, the second almost pleads for an answer to, “and then what?” even if it’s only, “and then we’ll move on to the

next step.”

# Work the clock

The teachers interviewed for this book constantly talk about time in their class-

rooms, and they Work the Clock. They count it down, parcel it out in highly speciﬁc increments, often announcing an allotted time for each activity: “Take

three minutes to answer the questions in front of you.” They mix in frequent countdowns to pace their class in completing tasks and emphasize the importance

of each second: “Pencils down and eyes on me in 5–4–3–2–1.” The countdown lends a sense of urgency to class time, reminding students that time matters and

hastening them along to the next step. What’s more, a countdown allows them to acknowledge productive behavior in an especially effective way.

Improving Your Pacing 233 Imagine you acknowledged two students, Brooklyn and Brian, because

they were ready in exactly the manner you’d asked. If you acknowledge them in the middle of a countdown (for example, by saying: “5, 4 . . . Brooklyn’s

ready! . . . 3, 2 . . . Brian’s sitting up and ready to roll! . . . and 1. Eyes on me and away we go!”), you are calling **attention** to behavior that not only meets but

exceeds expectations. You gave students until you reached one, but Brooklyn was ready at 4! She did more than comply with your wishes: she set the bar

high. Only by counting down the seconds did you make it evident to everyone that Brooklyn and Brian were ready early. Without the countdown, calling

**attention** to their readiness (“I see that Brooklyn is ready; Brian is ready too”) leaves you sounding weak, almost as if you were pleading with other students

to comply with your expectations by praising a few students who had complied or at least come close. After all there’s no way to tell, without the countdown,

whether you’re reinforcing excellence or mediocrity. Finally, using countdowns can allow you to continually set goals for your

class’s speed in meeting expectations: “I know we can do this in 10, but we’re Homeroom Hamilton. Let’s see if we can get ready in 6!” Now your standard

can be ever-increasing success rather than more than mere compliance. In a recent **lesson** in Patrick Pastore’s reading class at Rochester Prep, Patrick began

his countdown at 10. When he got to 4, all of his students were ready, so he announced: “And we don’t even need the rest. Let’s get started!”

# Reflection and practice

1.
Go through a **lesson** plan you’re likely to use in the next week, and if you don’t do this already, assign the time you think each activity

is likely to take. Now that you have general parameters, go through and ﬁnd every direction you’ll give to your students during the les-

son, and designate an amount of time you will allot to each activity. Write a short script for each that makes the amount of time avail-

able clear and gives a beginning and end prompt to brighten lines. 2.

Take the biggest single block of activity in your **lesson** (as measured in minutes), and try to break it into two or three activities with

Teach Like a Champion the same objective but with slightly different presentations. For

example, if you had a section of problems for a math **lesson** on rounding, you might divide it in half, with a clear line between

numerical and word problems. Then you might insert a brief reﬂec- tion on what rounding is and why we’d do it between the two

sections to make it seem like three. .

# Challenging students To think critically

Additional Techniques for Questioning

and Responding to Students The building process is

essentially the same whether there are three steps or three

hundred. A bigger goal means not bigger steps but more of

the same steady, manageable steps.

Questions asked strategically of students by teachers have been the heart of teach-

ing for about as long as there have been teachers and students. Effective

questions tend to come in groups that make the whole greater than the sum

of the parts, and questioning is the art of sequencing those questions in groups.

Good questioning builds solid mastery of even complex ideas by uncovering

and explicating each component piece of a concept in progression.

Assembling questioning sequences, then, is like building steps. If each step yields a steady and manageable rise and the organizing structure is sound, the

staircase can lead students up any height. The building process is essentially the same whether there are three steps or three hundred. A bigger goal means not

bigger steps but more of the same steady, manageable steps. By climbing steps day after day, students get good at climbing, good at systematically developing

Teach Like a Champion and breaking down ideas. Soon they rise without watching their feet or counting

their steps as they move ably and with quickness. Although the idea behind questioning is generally a constant, questioning

can serve at least ﬁve distinct purposes in effective classrooms. •

To guide students toward understanding when introducing material. The pur- pose is to methodically build knowledge and mastery of a preplanned skill or

concept (the objective) often by building gradually on a simpler idea and antic- ipating the places students will be confused. Example: “We know that we can

add fractions when they have the same denominator, that 1/3 plus 1/3 equals 2/3, but what about when the denominators aren’t equal? Would 1/3 plus 1/2 equal

2/5? Is that possible? Let’s look at our answer: Is 2 more or less than half of 5? Less. So 2/5 is more or less than 1/2? Less? But we can’t add something like 1/3

to 1/2 and get an answer that’s less than 1/2. So we must have a problem: we can’t just add the numerators and the denominators.”

• To push students to do a greater share of the thinking (increasing the

Ratio, technique 17). The purpose is to have students own deeply and fully acknowledge information they have previously been introduced to and begun

to master by forcing them to do the lion’s share of the work. This form of questioning is more likely than the ﬁrst to happen during the “We” or guided

practice portion of the **lesson**, while the ﬁrst is more likely to occur during the “I” part of the **lesson**. (See also Ratio.) Example: “So if I’m adding 1/2 and

1/3, what’s the ﬁrst thing I need to do, Kelsey? And how do I ﬁnd the lowest common denominator? Is that a complete answer, James? Does it capture

everything I need to do? What’s missing? Okay, so now that we know what to do, what is the lowest common denominator in this problem? All right, then,

what do I do next, Max?” •

To remediate an error. The teacher responds to a wrong answer (evidence of a student’s incomplete mastery of a concept) by breaking the original concept

down into smaller component parts and adding insight through more questions to build toward mastery of the original concept. These tend to be shorter,

reactive questioning sequences. (See Break It Down, technique 16.) Example: “Remember that the LCD is a number that can be divided by both of the

denominators. You said the LCD was 5. How many times does 3 go into 5?” •

To stretch students. The teacher responds to a student who has appeared to demonstrate mastery of a concept (answered one or several questions cor-

rectly) by pushing him to apply the concept at the next higher skill level or in a new setting, often to test for reliability of the correct answer. These also tend

Challenging Students to Think Critically 237 to be shorter, reactive questioning sequences. (See Stretch It, technique 3.)

Example: “Nice job adding 1/2 plus 1/3, Mark. Tell me, what would your LCD be if you wanted to add 1/2 to 1/7?”

• To check for understanding. The teacher uses questioning to test for mas-

tery, sampling a strategic array of students to discern how much of what she’s taught students have learned. (See Check for ****Understanding****, technique 18.)

Example: “Okay, before we move on, let’s see who’s got it! Albert, to get my LCD, I simply add the two denominators, right?”

The line of questioning can pursue more than one of these purposes at a time. A teacher might seek to both stretch her students and check for understanding at

the same time, say, by asking a student who answered correctly to explain the solution process.

Questioning is a complex and multifaceted skill that affects almost every part of teaching. Many of its most critical elements are covered at different places in

this book. For example, questioning is embedded in Stretch It (pushing students when they’ve answered correctly), Ratio (increasing the amount of cognitive

work students do), Break It Down (responding to student errors), and Check for ****Understanding**** (strategically testing for mastery). In addition to those aspects

of questioning, there are a few general rules of thumb for designing effective questioning, no matter its purpose.

# One at a time

Disciplining yourself to use the

One at a Time technique, particularly when you’re most

engaged and enthused, helps focus students on developing

one idea at a time and focuses you on questioning with a

speciﬁc goal or purpose in mind.

Given that questions often come in sequences, it’s easy to overlook a sim-

ple but critical rule of thumb for ques- tioning: ask one question at a time.

Ironically, teachers are most at risk of asking students more than one ques-

tion when they’re excited about what they are teaching and when the **content**

tempts them to push ahead too quickly. Disciplining yourself to use One at a

Time, particularly when you’re most engaged and enthused, helps focus stu-

dents on developing one idea at a time Teach Like a Champion

and focuses you on questioning with a speciﬁc goal or purpose in mind, not just a generalized desire to spark (any) discussion.

Consider a teacher reading Mrs. Frisby and the Rats of NIMH with her ﬁfth graders. She might ask something like, “Jason, how is the rats’ house different

from Mrs. Frisby’s, and which one do you think she would rather live in?” This question is really two, each with a distinct purpose: one asks Jason to compare

and contrast speciﬁc details, and the other asks him to infer a character’s point of view about an event. Unless the teacher is disciplined about attending to

both questions and ensuring that each gets answered in turn, Jason will most likely choose (perhaps arbitrarily) which of the two questions to answer, and the

other will fall by the wayside, never to be answered and subtly but persistently suggesting to the class that the teacher’s questions are not especially important or

planned. The message is not, “I have something speciﬁc and singularly important I want you to discuss,” but, “I just want you to discuss the book; any of a variety

topics will do equally.” In fact, if Jason is savvy, his choice of which question to answer won’t be

arbitrary: he’ll choose either the one that’s easier for him or the one he wants to answer more—not necessarily the one that would be better for him to answer.

This double question essentially devolves a critical learning decision—what’s the question we’re answering—to accident. Comparing and contrasting and inferring

a character’s perspective are critical but different reading comprehension skills, and it makes sense for a teacher to make an intentional decision about which

is more productive to ask Jason at that moment rather than leaving it to him to make a spur-of-the moment choice.

Furthermore, since she doesn’t know which question Jason will engage, she is immediately hampered in her planning. She can’t prepare—in her mind or,

better, as part of her preclass **lesson** planning—a series of follow-up questions to make visible to students how Mrs. Frisby’s character is reﬂected in her preference

for her own simple abode because she doesn’t control whether the issue reaches the discussion ﬂoor. And even if she’s disciplined about asking Jason to answer

both questions, she’ll be able to plan follow-up to only one or the other. Thus, in the end, one of her questions is highly likely to get shorter shrift than it deserves.

One reason many teachers may be inclined to ask more than one question at a time is that it’s easy to unconsciously model in classrooms the techniques

of interviewing seen in popular media. Though similarly driven by questions, interviews propose to inform and entertain, not to teach, which is very dif-

ferent. The interviewer hopes to generate a string of interesting, revealing, or Challenging Students to Think Critically 239

don’t-touch-that-dial remarks from an individual. Trying various questions to see which draws the most interesting response is an effective strategy, so interview-

ers may offer several questions at a time, hoping to elicit a vibrant response. In scholastic questioning, offering a menu of questions is more likely to cause con-

fusion or inefﬁciency. It is unclear which question to answer, easy to skip the hard ones, and more difﬁcult to sustain a conversation on a speciﬁc, focused topic.

In short, the ramiﬁcations of this mundane rule are far-reaching. Fortunately the solution is simple: ask one question at a time.

# Simple to complex

It’s effective to ask questions that progress from Simple to Complex. Like a

good **lesson** plan, effective questions initially engage students’ thinking about a topic in contained and concrete ways and then push them to think more deeply

and broadly. In the process of answering narrower and more focused questions, students begin to activate their memory of relevant facts and details to support

their opinions. They have time to develop and reﬂect on ideas, turning them into insights before they’re called on to share them in public. As a result, they will

likely answer broader and deeper questions more factually, more insightfully, and, having seen themselves succeed at initial questions, more conﬁdently and

with the willingness to take on greater risk. In a typical sequence about a novel or a historical period, for example, you might ask a few fact-based questions

to ensure that your students understood the facts and details of what happened. These might be organized from simpler to harder. Then you might start asking

questions that ask students to evaluate and prioritize that information: What was the most important event in the story? What did we learn that most helped us

to understand the main character? What were the most important events in the historical period, and what do they tell you about people’s values then? After

that, you might move to a few questions that ask students to apply their ideas more broadly. How would you compare or contrast the main character’s behavior

in this chapter to his behavior at some other point in the novel? What are the most important lessons from this period in history that are still relevant today?

While this latter group of questions is arguably more interesting, they’ll yield less value if you jump right to them without establishing and afﬁrming both a

fact base and the logical building blocks from which students can conduct their deeper thinking.

Teach Like a Champion

# Verbatim (no bait and switch)

Some teachers unintentionally

pull a Bait-and-Switch on their students, changing the

question after a student has raised his hand and begun to

formulate a response. Most teachers ask a question, wait for

hands, and then call on a student to answer. However, before the chosen

student answers, they often restate the question. It’s often useful and occa-

sionally critical to do this, especially when asking a challenging question.

However, in repeating the question, it’s important to remember to ask the same

question Verbatim.

Some teachers

unintentionally pull a Bait-and-Switch on their students, changing the question after a student has raised his hand and begun to formulate a response. This

seems harmless but can have several negative consequences. First, the student with his hand raised is now asked to respond aloud to a question that is different

from what he volunteered to speak about. He is not prepared, and the quality of the answer is likely to be lower. Even a moderate change in syntax can

force a student to revise the syntax of the answer he’s been preparing, leaving him confused or distracted at exactly the moment he’s onstage. If you ask your

students to take the risk of answering questions about which they are less than 100 percent conﬁdent (and you should ask them to take that risk), they deserve

to know what the question will be, have time to consider their response, and answer the question they think they’ll get to answer. In many cases, students are

left in stumped silence by a change in the question that may appear insigniﬁcant to the teacher—for example, a change from, “Why do you think the author

wrote this article?” to, “What was the purpose of this article?” If your questions matter, you want students to hear them, consider them, and

participate based on thoughtful reﬂection. Make that easier for them by keeping the question constant.

# Clear and concise

Too often the problem with a wrong answer is not with the answer but with

the question. It sounds obvious to note that students should know what you are asking them if you want them to have the chance to answer correctly. Here

Challenging Students to Think Critically 241 are ﬁve ways to use the Clear and Concise technique to improve the clarity of

your questions: •

Start with a question word. When you begin a sentence with who, when, what, where, why, or how, your students instantly know it’s a question and

can begin thinking about a response. You also increase the likelihood that the **kind** of answer you want will be clear. Asking, “Can you add to that?”

provides little guidance; it is unlikely to yield the **kind** of answer you want and to provide students with the chance to prepare a response they are conﬁdent in.

Sentences that begin with Is are ﬁne too, although that they often yield yes or no answers—short responses that are hard to follow up on and don’t usually

yield great discussion. •

Limit them to two clauses. Asking questions in ornate sentences that sound as if they come from a Henry James novel may work for college professors

but often confuse students younger than college age. Make your questions rigorous and demanding, but limit them to two clauses most of the time so

students are clear on what you’re asking. •

Write them in advance when they matter. The best way to ask exactly the right questions is to script them in advance as part of the **lesson** planning

process—both the initial question and your response if students aren’t able to answer as you’d hoped. This is perhaps the single driver of better teaching

that most developing teachers roundly ignore. •

Ask an actual question. Say, “Why doesn’t Stewart think so?” rather than making a statement like, “But Stewart doesn’t think so.” If you do the latter,

students have the right to be confused. Are you asking them a question? •

Assume the answer. Ask, “Who can tell me . . . ,” not, “Can anyone tell me . . . ” The ﬁrst assumes someone can answer, and a student thinks, “Who

can? I can!” “Can anyone” expresses doubt that anyone will, and doubt makes students less likely to assume that someone like them should put their hand up.

# Stock questions

I recently showed a video of one of the best questioners I know, Jaimie Brillante,

to a group of teachers. In the video, Brillante’s questions come at students fast and furious:

“Is that a run-on sentence?” “I think so.”

Teach Like a Champion “Well, how would you know?”

“There would be two subjects and two predicates.” “If I wanted to prove it, which of those would I start looking for ﬁrst?”

“The predicate.” “And can you ﬁnd a predicate?”

“Is it owner?” “Why can’t owner be a predicate?”

“It’s not a verb.” “Well that would explain it. What part of speech is owner?” [No answer].

“Well, think of other –er words: dancer, singer, teacher. What are those?” “They’re all people. They all nouns.”

“And does an owner seem the same?” “Yes.”

“And so the predicate must have what?” “A verb.”

In Brillante’s **lesson**, students are working hard and fast, getting a serious intellectual workout demonstrating knowledge and ﬁxing errors. Observing Bril-

lante in action is daunting for a teacher. How can the rest of us hope to think on our feet like that and ask artful sequences of clear questions over and over again

while running a class? Afterward I asked Brillante what the secret to her questioning was. She

replied, “One important thing is that I’m not making my questions up on the spot. I am asking versions of the same few questions over and over. I’ve drilled

them to know that it’s easier to ﬁnd the predicate than it is to ﬁnd the subject. So I always ask them, when they’re testing for a complete sentence or a run-on,

‘Should we try to ﬁnd the predicate or the subject ﬁrst?’ And they know that they need to ﬁnd the predicate ﬁrst because verbs are easier to ﬁnd. I try to have

a logical approach to typical problems and then follow that approach over and over. It looks as if I am thinking of ﬁve fast questions to ask in a row, but I am

really making a decision to ask one sequence of questions in a row.” Challenging Students to Think Critically 243

In short, Brillante’s questioning is based on theme and variation: similar sequences of questions applied over and over in different settings. Obviously

these Stock Questions can’t occur in all cases and with all material, but she is making far fewer decisions than she appears to be. She’s not deciding on ﬁve

questions but on one sequence of questions with ﬁve fairly predictable parts. This reduces the intellectual daunting demands of questioning and makes it practical

to execute.

# Hit rate

A last aspect of questioning to attend to is Hit Rate: the rate at which students

answer your questions correctly (or adequately and thoroughly, in the case of questions where there’s no ﬁrm right answer). If your hit rate is 100 percent,

that’s not necessarily a good thing unless you’ve just wrapped up a review. Or put another way, it’s good if your hit rate starts at 100 percent, but it should

not remain that way for long: when kids get everything right, it’s time to ask harder questions. Asking harder questions as your hit rate approaches 100 percent

allows you to test the full extent of student knowledge and retain adequate rigor. By the same token, a hit rate below two out of three shows that you’ve got a

problem with either how you presented the material you taught or how aligned your questions are to that material. Your kids are not showing you mastery, a

result that should give you pause.

# How to reinforce effective questioning

A variety of techniques discussed elsewhere in this book are also critical to

effective questioning. A brief discussion of several of them follows. Break It Down

The capacity to break down ideas or questions that confuse students into smaller or simpler questions is arguably the critical questioning skill. Too often teachers

respond to the entirely normal and useful process of student answering incorrectly in one of three inefﬁcient ways: repeating the same question, telling the student

the answer, or calling on another student to answer and not returning to the initial student. When a student fails the answer correctly, Break It Down (technique

16) is the best strategy. It assists the teacher in understanding what part of the Teach Like a Champion

question posed difﬁculty and causes students to both draw on and develop what knowledge they do have. A variety of Break It Down strategies are discussed in

Chapter Two. 

# No Opt Out

A related technique, discussed in Chapter One, is No Opt Out (technique 1). In several of the variations on it, the teacher returns to a student who was unable

to answer an initial question, asking her to repeat the correct answer given by another student or to use additional information provided by the other student to

solve the problem herself. No Opt Out questions might include, “Who can tell Charlene the ﬁrst step she needs to use to solve this?” “Who can tell Charlene

where she could ﬁnd the answer?” or “Who can tell Charlene what we mean by [a troubling concept or term]?”

Right Is Right and Stretch It If Break It Down and No Opt Out are useful for remediating wrong answers by

students, Right Is Right (technique 2) adds two pieces to the picture. The “All the Way Right” portion of the technique is useful for getting students who give

mostly correct answers all the way there: “I think you’ve characterized accurately how the main character acts in public, but is there more to say about how he

acts in private?” The “Answer My Question” portion of the technique is useful when students answer a question other than the one you’ve asked, a much more

common problem than most people suspect. Stretch It (technique 3), by contrast, improves your questioning by reminding

you that the learning process doesn’t end with a right answer. Pushing students with a variety of follow-up questions is one of the most valuable ways to increase

the rigor of your classroom. Ratio

Several aspects of Ratio (technique 17) are also useful for questioning. Unbundling is the process of taking a large, multipart question and dividing

it into a series of smaller questions that are rapidly distributed to a variety of class members, usually using Cold Call (technique 22). Rather than asking

one student what the three dimensions of volume are, for example, a teacher might unbundle by saying, “How many dimensions of volume are there, Tyra?

Good, what’s one of the dimensions, Keith? What’s another, Carlton? And the last, Jennifer? Good. And what number do we use for pi, the last dimension,

Paula?” This technique has the effect of increasing the pacing of the **lesson** and Challenging Students to Think Critically 245

involving more students. It also forces students to listen carefully to their peers’ responses and adjust accordingly. Carlton can’t offer length as his answer if

Keith says it ﬁrst. A second aspect of Ratio that’s particularly useful in questioning is to feign

ignorance, that is, pretend not to know the answer or make a mistake and thus require students to correct and explain the error.

Cold Call Cold Call is especially useful in situations above and beyond unbundling. It’s

the fastest, most effective way to make students accountable for staying engaged with your questioning, keep the pace of your questions fast and rigorous, and

ensure your capacity to use questions to check for understanding. It ensures your ability to steer any question to the student you most want to answer it at any time.

# Part Two Helping Students Get the Most Out of ****Reading****: Critical Skills and Techniques

# Chapter ten

# How all teachers can (and must) be reading Teachers

****Reading**** is the skill. ****Teaching**** students to unlock the full meaning of the texts they

read is the single most powerful outcome a teacher can foster. If your students can read well, they can essentially do anything. I’ve included this chapter on

reading in the book to **help** all teachers, not just in certain classes but across the school in every room, use the methods of champion reading teachers to structure

reading in their classrooms and ensure that students do lots and lots of it, and in ways that maximize productivity. If you teach, no matter the subject, you have

the opportunity and the obligation to ensure that your students read more (and better). This opportunity will result in their being both more informed regarding

the topic of your **instruction** and more effective assimilators and analyzers of information—better readers—in the future. It’s a double investment paying both

short- and long-term results. I have a friend whose father continually stressed the power of reading to

him when he was growing up. To prove it, he pulled my friend out of school for several months, bought a series of books on building, even though he had

previously been only moderately handy, and proceeded, with my friend alongside, to build a house from foundation to shingles. My friend recalls sitting on beams

in the twilight, he and his father reading aloud with great intensity on plumbing or framing or wiring, sometimes working through the complex passages three

and four times. Teach Like a Champion

Schools, however, have increasingly come to teach reading in a more speciﬁc and more limited sense, as a mere noun: a speciﬁc subject area for intentional

study. We train our English and literacy teachers to teach a subject called ****Reading****. Certainly there’s a great deal of value in thinking of reading as primarily a

subject, particularly at the elementary level where phonics has (or should have) revolutionized the efﬁcacy of early literacy **instruction** and where specialized

**instruction** is a key lever in creating lasting reading gains among students. But the value of reading arguably lies just as much in its status as a verb, that is,

students reading frequently and broadly as a key goal of schooling. Not only do the reading programs and English classes in many schools fail to include

much actual reading (in the verb sense), but untapped opportunities to read more effectively occur throughout every corner of the building. Still, schools are far

less likely to maximize these opportunities, and even less likely to train teachers how to take advantage of them. Nevertheless, the overall value of the additional

high-quality reading you could do in a typical school day could equal or possibly exceed the value of what happens in designated reading classes. When you stop

to consider how much high-quality reading students might do outside reading class, the untapped potential is massive, but for now most students simply don’t

read much. Consider four of the most enduring intellects to have worked and written in

the English language: Abraham Lincoln, Fredrick Douglass, Jane Austen, and Charles Dickens. They were all educated similarly, but perhaps not how you’d

think. Each received little or no formal schooling. Essentially self-educated in an era when self-education meant reading, they rose to eminence by virtue of the

skills and knowledge their private reading taught them. I am not suggesting that their educations provide a model of what education

should be. Still, they remind us of the almost unlimited capacity of diligent read- ing to teach. For all four of these exceptional people and many others, “mere”

reading was sufﬁcient to foster and develop rare genius. And as for the rest of us, we are all self-educated, to some degree or another, by virtue of the reading

we have done. Leaﬁng back in my mind through the ideas gleaned from my private reading,

I know that they have shaped me as much as my schooling has. We are what we have read and how we read it, and no other single activity has the capacity

to yield so much educational value. And yet students in many schools spend precious little time actually reading. Likely, they read for less than an hour a

day. Even in their reading or literature classes, they are as likely to talk about How All Teachers Can (and Must) Be ****Reading**** Teachers 251

We are what we have read and how we read it, and no

educational value. And yet students in many schools

spend precious little actually reading. Likely, they read for

less than an hour a day. reading or respond to what they may

(or may not) have read as they are to actually read. For her dissertation, a col-

league followed students through their day at New York City public schools and

found that they read for an average of ten minutes per day. Worse, 40 percent

of them did no reading at all. Making “mere reading” highly pro-

ductive and effective in your classroom is a critical skill no matter what sub-

ject or grade level you teach, and this chapter explains how you can do that,

both practically (how you can ensure that classmates are reading along with a student who’s reading aloud) and pedagogically (how and when you should

ask what kinds of questions). It also contains guidance especially useful to English and language arts teachers whose goal is to use techniques like “strate-

gies” to make students “readers” over and above their mastery of any spe- ciﬁc text.

Although I’ve tried to provide guidance for both teachers generally and spe- cialists, I underscore two key assumptions in this chapter: everybody in a school

must be a reading teacher and the generalist techniques may be the most produc- tive for study by specialists. In many cases, they are highly trained in the subtle

arts of interpretation and textual analysis but leave value on the table due to a lack of proﬁciency In other words, they may fall into the trap that many other

specialists—heart surgeons or data analysts, for example—face: losing sight of the basics. The point of this chapter is to bring those basics back into focus. As

one excellent teacher said to me, “I’m a certiﬁed English teacher and a pretty good one at teaching kids to interpret what we read, but I don’t know the ﬁrst

thing about what to do when a kid can’t read a word.” The chapters in Part Two offer approaches for helping all students improve

their reading. They cover a set of skills that is obvious to some practitioners but where the approach taken by top teachers provides guidance that is critically

important for all: •

Decoding—the process of deciphering written text to identify the spoken words it represents

Teach Like a Champion •

Fluency—consists of automaticity, the ability to read at a rapid rate, plus expression, the ability to group words together into phrases to reﬂect meaning

and tone •

****Vocabulary****—a student’s base of word knowledge: how many words she knows and how well she knows them

• ****Comprehension****—how much of what’s written a student understands

****Comprehension**** sits in a strange position within this list as it requires both a set of techniques of its own and also the mastery of the other three: you teach

ﬂuency, decoding, and vocabulary in order to ensure robust comprehension. How- ever, when comprehension doesn’t work, it may be that students weren’t able to

make certain inferences or distinguish trivial from critical details, but it’s just as likely that the problem was that they couldn’t read the passage with sufﬁ-

cient ﬂuidity and automaticity to allow them to use their processing capacity to understand its subtleties. They may be using so much of their mental capacity

bandwidth merely processing the words that they can’t remember the beginning of the paragraph (or the sentence) by the time they get to the end. And it’s

important to remember that all students face this challenge. In the ﬁrst year of my graduate studies in English literature, most of us were so busy trying to

unpack the jargon of the ﬁeld and the impenetrable syntax of academic writ- ing that our comprehension sagged woefully—not because we couldn’t grasp

the ideas but because the presentation posed barriers to ﬂuency, decoding, and vocabulary. And presentation can pose such barriers to every reader, no mat-

ter who, and often deliberately so (the novels of William Faulkner and Gabriel Garcia M´arquez are good examples).

The information in Part Two focuses broadly on making reading more effec- tive and rigorous in any classroom and for any purpose—whether you’re reading

“The Three Little Bears,” Plato, Chapter Seven of Cell: The Building Blocks of Life, the directions to a math problem, or a description of the Gettysburg Address.

The guidance here is equally applicable to teachers of reading as a speciﬁc sub- ject. However, since the art of teaching reading comprehension as a fungible

skill that students learn to master and apply in any future situation is also the challenging and nuanced provenance of specialists—reading teachers—Part Two

also contains speciﬁc guidance for those teachers. The last chapter on compre- hension also contains a discussion of aspects of reading that are more speciﬁcally

(but not exclusively) relevant to language arts or reading classrooms. In partic- ular, I discuss in this section the reading strategies so many reading teachers

currently use. How All Teachers Can (and Must) Be ****Reading**** Teachers 253

# Making reading **instruction** productive

# And accountable: control the game

So how do busy teachers integrate reading **instruction** into their classrooms in

a way that will be productive and keep students accountable? This challenge involves a set of skills that are often overlooked but are critically important.

I call these skills Control the Game. Imagine, for a moment, a hypothetical school. This school values reading

above all other endeavors—to an exaggerated degree. In its reading classes, it provides direct, intentional **instruction** on reading: phonics and comprehension

at the lower grade levels, intentional focus on key terms and concepts like char- acterization and theme at the middle school level, introduction to college prep

literature at the high school level, and vocabulary at all grade levels. It has recently decided to ensure that its students spend almost all their time in school

reading. In science classes, they read chapters from articles and textbooks. In history class, they read primary and secondary source materials, often for the

entire class period. They do write, but usually summaries and analyses of what they’ve read. In math, they supplement their problem sets with reading, and new

concepts are often introduced in short descriptive texts. Imagine also that teachers in the school are able to consistently ensure that students, when asked to read,

actually do read and read effectively and with attentiveness. As a result, students in the school read for six or seven hours a day, plus homework.

Might reading for six or seven hours a day, 190 days a year,

if you could ensure the reading was of reasonable

quality, achieve better outcomes than many schools

today foster? I offer this prospect as a hypothetical

model, not a proposal for actual educa- tional programs. My goal is not to say

I think it would make for a viable school model but to cause you to reﬂect on what

the results of such a school would be. Might reading for six or seven hours

a day, 190 days a year, if you could ensure the reading was of reasonable

quality, achieve better outcomes than many schools today foster? Obviously

there’s no way to answer this question. The fact is that the answer could plau- sibly be yes and that the question (“If we could ensure that students read well

would it be better to read?”) should be on our minds as teachers. If a teacher can ensure that her students can be relied on to read well, she can always, at

any time and for any duration, ensure that a high-value activity, the single most important skill of the educated citizen, will take place in her classroom. If she

Teach Like a Champion can do that, she can consistently invest her time at a reliable rate of return. She

need never oversee a low-value activity again. She has a hurdle rate: a rate of return she must exceed on an investment of her time to make it worthwhile.

The term hurdle rate comes from ﬁnance. If you know you can predictably earn 10 percent on every dollar you invest in a certain bond, for example, and

you know that bond is always available to you, you would naturally avoid any investment that returned you less than 10 percent since you could always do better

with your bond. The question you’d ask in assessing any potential investment is not, “Will it make me money?” but, “Will it beat my hurdle rate?” That is,

you’d ask whether any investment would yield a stronger return than the best alternative investment you know you could make. Businesses ask this **kind** of

question all the time. A technology ﬁrm’s owners wouldn’t ask, “Would building a new factory to manufacture cell phones make us money?” if its resources

are limited. If its owners invest millions in building the cell phone factory, they must choose not to do something else with that money—say, invest it in

expanding their existing computer factory. Faced with the possibility of proﬁts in cell phones, they would ask whether investing in a cell phone plant would

exceed their hurdle rate. In this case, “Would building a factory to manufacture cell phones earn us more than would investing the money in expanding our

current computer factories?” The decision is a choice between the return you know you can get (from your existing computer operations) and the potential of

any new project (the cell phones). If you could make an 8 percent return on the cell phone factory, it would still not make sense to do it if your rate of return

was 10 percent for expanding computer operations. Just because you can make money manufacturing cell phones doesn’t mean you should do it.

Although we also manage ﬁnite resources as teachers—in this case, time—we rarely think this way. We ask whether our actions will result in learn-

ing, but this is the wrong question. The right question is whether our actions yield a return that exceeds our hurdle rate—that is, yield more learning per minute

invested than does the best reliable alternative use of class time. And we rarely spend time thinking about developing the strongest and most reliable hurdle rate.

In the classrooms of many teachers whose teaching informed this book, meaning- ful reading (a term I’ll deﬁne in a minute) provides an exceptionally strong and

reliable hurdle rate. It’s a high-quality activity (when done efﬁciently) that can be carried out in any classroom, at any time, and with limited additional preparation

or expense required. You can always invest any stretch of time, short or long, in meaningful reading and reap a strong and predictable return. Furthermore, if

you know you could always be doing meaningful reading—in any class, at How All Teachers Can (and Must) Be ****Reading**** Teachers 255

any time—you can examine your other investments of time critically: Do they exceed the value of meaningful reading? Are they potentially higher return but

riskier and therefore should be balanced with something more reliable? As you ask these questions, you may well ﬁnd that reading crowds out some of the other

ways you invest your time. Surely not all of them, but probably some of them do not exceed your hurdle rate (that is, they are not reliably more productive than

meaningful reading). It would be smarter to have them read meaningfully instead. It makes sense to pause here and deﬁne the term meaningful reading more

speciﬁcally because it is critical to this discussion. For the purposes of this book, I deﬁne meaningful reading as reading that is accountable, moderately expressive,

and highly leveraged. By accountable, I mean that teachers are able to reliably assess whether students are actually reading (rather than, say, sitting looking at

pictures or out the window daydreaming when they are supposed to be reading) and reading effectively (decoding and reading words correctly and diligently, for

example, rather than reinscribing errors such as ignoring sufﬁxes or skipping over the difﬁcult parts of the text). Much of the reading students do in schools fails to

meet this criterion. In one commonly used program, Drop Everything and Read (DEAR), for example, students are given quiet time in which they sit with books

and are expected to read. It’s a lovely idea, but if you observe students during this program, you will invariably see some of them sitting with books open but

eyes drifting across the room or out the window. Some ﬂip idly through pages, gazing at pictures, while others read lazily or poorly, practicing and reinscribing

weak habits as they go. Unfortunately, the students reading least are often the ones who need to read the most. This fails the accountability test. As a result,

the rate of return on this activity may be low. ****Learning**** to invest reading with a strong dose of accountability is a key focus of this chapter.

By moderately expressive, I mean that students demonstrate the capacity to embed meaning in words as they read, to show in their inﬂection that they

are processing the words at a level beyond the most basic level. We’re not talking about Sir John Gielgud here—just the basics: nonrobotic reading with

demonstrated recognition of punctuation and periodic recognition (by emphasis) of key words. Although expressive reading is insufﬁcient to the ﬁnal task of

a full and rich understanding of a text, it is highly efﬁcient as an indicator of basic understanding. Expressing the meaning and register of the words in

the manner you are reading them demonstrates comprehension, the end goal of reading **instruction**.

Many teachers scorn the idea of allowing a single student to read aloud during class time. “What are the other kids doing?” they ask. In meaningful reading, the

Teach Like a Champion answer is that they are also reading—to themselves, in step with the student

reading aloud. I call the degree to which other students are reading “leverage,” and it’s the third critical element of meaningful reading. If one student is reading

aloud and her classmates are listening passively, there’s a leverage factor of 1, signifying a highly inefﬁcient activity. However, if one student is reading aloud

and twenty-ﬁve students are silently but accountably reading along with her at their desks, you have a leverage factor of twenty-six. Twenty-six people reading

makes for a highly efﬁcient and worthwhile activity. If twenty-six people are reading, your hurdle rate is much, much higher so the question becomes very

quickly, How do you get that leverage? The Control the Game skills explain how to get and sustain consistently high rates of leverage. When they are reading,

everyone reads, and reads accountably, with the result being an especially high hurdle rate and, over time, consistently higher-value activities in the classroom

because the hurdle rate raises the investment criteria for their time. Skeptics about the efﬁcacy of having a single student reading out loud

might ask how the text could be appropriately leveled for the whole class or whether it was injurious to students’ self-esteem if they strug-

gled publicly. Without engaging in an extended philosophical debate, I would argue that there is nothing inherently injurious to self-esteem

about getting something wrong, especially if students learn to do it suc- cessfully over time. In that case, the opposite is probably the outcome.

Regardless, as Roy Baumeister has demonstrated in his excellent article on the topic, ‘‘Rethinking Self-Esteem: Why Nonproﬁts Should Stop Pushing

Self-Esteem and Start Endorsing Self-Control’’ (Stanford Social Innovation Review, Winter 2005), there’s little to support the idea that enhancing self-

esteem is a worthy goal in schools. The best you can say is that it correlates to (rather than causes) achievement. That is, when students achieve, they

believe in themselves, not the other way around. As for leveled texts, many to most of the top-performing urban charter schools of which I’m aware

buck the otherwise orthodox belief in heterogeneous classroom grouping and solve this problem by homogeneously grouping classes. That said,

even if you do or cannot homogeneously group, a bit of prescreening can **help** you target sections of the text to appropriate readers or even to

prepare struggling readers by introducing phrases and words in advance for them.

How All Teachers Can (and Must) Be ****Reading**** Teachers 257 Once you’ve mastered Control the Game and can reliably achieve a fully

leveraged and meaningful read, you too can use that skill to set your hurdle rate and rigorously assess whether your classroom activities exceed it in value.

I am conﬁdent that you will ﬁnd many such things. You will do a lot more than just read. But you should always seek to consider your hurdle rate and

subject every other activity to a comparison. Furthermore, I acknowledge that as students gain in maturity and proﬁciency, the deﬁnition of meaningful reading

may change: silent individual reading that doesn’t test as explicitly for account- ability may become more frequent, for example. But the skills described in this

chapter are critical because they get students to the point in their academic careers where high-value independent reading is possible, and they increase the

value of those sessions if invested in systematically. Also, most urban public schools probably fail to get the majority of their students to the point where

their independent reading is fully meaningful and productive. In those schools, reading falls victim to the logistical problems of poor accountability and low

leverage. I fervently hope your classroom reaches the point where Control the Game is unnecessary and less productive than mere silent reading. It will be

a joyous day when more classrooms do not need to manage reading in this way. I would merely caution you against assuming you have that classroom

without further evidence from and training of your students, possibly over mul- tiple years.

# Control the game skills

Keep Durations Unpredictable

When you ask a student to read aloud during class, that student is the primary reader. As the designation suggests, this student is not the only reader. While

the practice the primary reader gets is critical, the actions and focus of all other students are also critical: they must become secondary readers. So when you

identify your primary reader, don’t specify how long you want him to read before he actually begins. “Start reading for me please, James,” or “Pick up

please, James,” is far better than is, “Read the next paragraph for me, James.” This ensures that other students in the class don’t know when a new reader will

be asked to pick up and therefore provides them with a strong incentive to follow along carefully. This makes them more likely to be secondary readers.

In addition, keeping duration unpredictable allows you to address an over- matched primary reader in a noninvasive manner. A primary reader who struggles

mightily with a long paragraph risks losing the engagement and concentration of his or her peers, who may lose track of the narrative thread. This reduces

Teach Like a Champion leverage. When you’ve committed to a full paragraph, you lose your ability to

cut a primary reader’s session short and have him or her try again with a better passage without it becoming obvious. If you don’t specify the length of the read,

you can shorten or lengthen as you need to in the interest of both the primary reader and the rest of the class.

Keep the Identity of the Next Reader Unpredictable If you move quickly from one primary reader to another, students focus more

closely on following along. This is doubly true if they don’t know who the next primary reader will be. A teacher who announces that she’ll go around the room

in a predictable fashion gives away this part of her leverage. Students can tune out until their turn is near. Holding on to your ability to choose the next reader

also allows you to match students to passages more effectively. Retaining unpre- dictability makes for better leverage and better reading.

Keep Durations Short ****Reading**** for short segments maximizes the concentration of the primary reader.

It allows students to invest expressive energy in reading and focus intently on and sustain ﬂuent and even dramatic reading. This yields higher-quality oral reading

and makes the **lesson** more engaging. Moving quickly among primary readers also keeps the pacing lively. The **lesson** feels quick and energetic as a result rather

than tedious and slow. Knowing that segments tend to be short and may end at any time because they aren’t predictable also reinforces for secondary readers

that they will likely soon get a chance themselves to read, and this keeps them from tuning out. Keeping durations short allows you to take better advantage

of a crucial form of data: every time you switch readers, you gather data about your leverage. When you say, “Pick up please, Charles,” and Charles jumps in

with the next sentence without missing a beat, you know Charles was reading alongside the previous reader on his own. Ideally, you want this sort of seamless

transition every time you switch readers, and switching frequently allows you to gather and manage this more frequently and broadly. The more data you have,

the more information and tools you will have to **help** you ensure leverage. Reduce Transaction Costs

A transaction cost is the amount of resources needed to execute an exchange; it can be economic, verbal, or something else. If it takes you three days of driving

to different stores to ﬁnd the best price on a TV, your transaction cost is high How All Teachers Can (and Must) Be ****Reading**** Teachers 259

(three days of your time)—possibly higher in dollar value than the potential savings you’d get from buying the less expensive TV. When you manage ﬁnite

resources like time and **attention**, as teachers do, transaction costs are both crit- ically important and easy to miss. A shopper spending three days searching for

a twenty-dollar savings on a TV might think he’s gotten a steal, but if he spent one of those days working and then bought the more expensive TV, he’d have

both more than ten dollars and two days left over. A transaction cost is implicit

in every transition in the classroom, especially in

transitions you make fre- quently, like moving from one

reader to the next. A transaction cost is implicit in

every transition in the classroom, espe- cially in transitions you make frequently,

like moving from one reader to the next. Still, many teachers fail to recog-

nize their signiﬁcance. A transaction that takes more than a few seconds steals

reading time and risks interrupting the continuity of what students are reading,

thus affecting how well students follow and comprehend the text. Make it your goal to transition from one primary reader to another quickly

and with a minimum of words—and ideally in a consistent way. “Susan, pick up,” is a much more efﬁcient transition than, “Thank you, Stephen. Nicely read.

Susan will you begin reading, please?” Since it’s more than three times as quick, the ﬁrst transaction reduces threefold the amount of time students are not reading.

It also keeps the narrative thread vibrant and alive in students’ minds since it’s subject to less interruption. Because it’s quick, it also allows you to step in and

use it at almost any natural pause in the text, which gives you more control over when to choose a new primary reader.

Use Bridging to Maintain Continuity In bridging, a teacher reads a short segment of text—a bridge—between

primary student readers. In a typical sequence of bridging, a teacher might allow Stewart to read for three sentences and then read one sentence herself.

Then she might allow Mary to read four sentences and read two sentences herself before asking John to read for six sentences and reading one herself and

then passing off to Jane. The beneﬁt of this method is that it moves the story along quickly and keeps the narrative thread alive, while interspersing teacher-

quality expressive reading, which maximizes comprehension. I am arguing Teach Like a Champion

for discretionary bridging when it’s important to keep the narrative thread alive and create more opportunities to model. Generally the harder the text, the more

you might consider bridging. But you needn’t necessarily always bridge. Oral Cloze

I learned the oral cloze technique from watching Roberto de Leon teach reading to third-grade boys at Excellence Charter ****School**** for Boys in Bedford Stuyvesant.

In one example, de Leon kicked off his reading of Phantom of the Opera by leaving a word out at the end of his ﬁrst sentence: “Carlotta had the . . . ,” he

read, snapping quietly on the word the to alert his students that they should ﬁll in the blank. On the day in question, only a handful of his boys chimed in “leading

role” exactly on cue. So Rob started over, “Ooh, some boys weren’t quite with us. Let’s try that again. ‘Carlotta had the . . . ,’” and all his boys chimed in with

“leading role” demonstrating that they were now following along. This quick device, which de Leon uses throughout his lessons, allows him to quickly and

simply assess leverage. Rely on a Placeholder

As the best reading teachers move between reading and questioning their stu- dents about what they read, they use quick and reliable prompts to ensure that

their students recognize the transition and react promptly. I call this prompt a placeholder, because it is used to ensure that students retain their place in the

text so they can quickly and immediately transition back to reading after dis- cussion. “Hold your place. Track me,” announces Patrick Pastore, modeling for

his sixth graders how to point to the spot where they left off reading Esper- anza Rising, close their books partway, and engage his eyes to show they are

ready to discuss. After a brief discussion of why Esperanza and Miguel react differently to a train ride, he instructs, “Pick up reading please, Melanie.” In less

than two seconds, she and her classmates are back into the book at almost no transaction cost.

“Finger in your book; close your book,” intones de Leon as he prepares his students to discuss Phantom of the Opera and also prepares them to end that

discussion and return to the book efﬁciently. Leadership Prep’s Hannah Lofthus uses a similar expression (“ﬁnger freeze”), with her third graders, modeling for

them how to keep their place when the reading is interrupted. How All Teachers Can (and Must) Be ****Reading**** Teachers 261

****Teaching**** Decoding, ****Vocabulary****

Development, and Fluency Once you’ve mastered the skills in Chapter Ten and have your students reading

more frequently and with greater leverage, mastering the methods of champion teachers in three core elements of literacy **instruction**—decoding, vocabulary,

and ﬂuency—can increase the quality and productivity of your students’ reading, making them more attentive, more expressive readers and building a foundation

that will increase the comprehension they take from their reading, no matter what subject you teach.

# Decoding

Decoding is the process of deciphering written text to identify the spoken words it

represents. Although decoding might appear at ﬁrst to be a mundane, lower-order skill, its mastery is a prerequisite to all reading comprehension and thus to most

learning. It’s the foundation. Incomplete mastery of decoding can persist well beyond the elementary grades and detract from the success of even apparently

advanced students. If a third-grade student labors over just two or three of the words in a sentence, concentrating his energy on piecing together each letter’s

contribution, he will likely have little memory left over to absorb the meaning of the sentence or even to remember the beginning by the time he reaches the

end. If a middle school student in history class reads a passage about the causes of the Civil War but leaves the s off the verbs, the syntax of the sentence

Teach Like a Champion will erode. The student may remember pieces of the main point but will fail to

develop a cohesive understanding. If a high school student allocates much of her mental energy to sounding out new terms in a passage about representative

government—ﬁlibuster, cloture, and perquisite—she may fail to attend to much else or even imprint the words’ meanings. If she gets the names or words wrong

or breezes over them with only the roughest approximations, she may fail to recognize them in future discussion, conversation, or reading.

Given the bedrock importance of decoding at every level, teachers should strive to correct decoding errors whenever possible, no matter what subject

or grade level they teach. Since these errors often indicate a broader lack of knowledge or skills, reinforcing general rules and ensuring that students prac-

tice decoding are the antidotes. However, many teachers who correct decoding errors fail to do either of these, opting instead to correct the error and ask

the student to make an “echo correction”—that is, to repeat the correct word without decoding it. There are times when an echo correction is necessary,

but it only gets the student through the word in the immediate situation. It doesn’t increase the likelihood of success the next time the student encounters

the word. So what sorts of actions are better than an echo correction? If a student can’t

read might, the best way to correct such a decoding error may be to improve her knowledge of the rules. After all, she’s likely to struggle with sight and

tight as well. Rather than saying, “That word is might,” the teacher might say, “–i-g-h-t says ‘ite.’ Now try that word again.” This has two beneﬁts: it requires

the student to incorporate the new information and then decode the original word successfully, and it reinforces a rule she can use on other high-frequency words.

The next time the teacher corrects, he or she might say, “‘-i-g-h-t’ says . . . ?” and ask the student to recall and then apply the rule. In most cases, asking students

to self-correct by applying a rule or new information—“That vowel is a long a. Now try that word again,” is another typical example—is powerful because it

addresses the cause, not just the symptom, and thus contributes to a long-term solution.

Even so, exceptions are the rule in English—arguably one of our language’s most distinguishing characteristics. Many words are simply impossible or unre-

warding to decode. In fact, sight words are often learned by rote speciﬁcally because rules do not apply to them. Where the ideal of self-correcting isn’t pos-

sible, the key is to recognize such cases quickly so as not to waste time and create confusion.

The Fundamentals 265 Transaction Costs and Decoding

A transaction cost is the amount of resources it takes to execute an exchange—be it economic, verbal, or something else. Think again of the ten dollar “savings”

on the TV in the example in Chapter Ten. Transaction costs are most important in those interactions that happen frequently since frequency multiplies the impor-

tance of efﬁciency. This makes managing transaction costs especially relevant to addressing decoding errors.

Decoding errors are common and usually of short duration—a student reads “hope” as “hop” and the whole sequence, whether it gets corrected or not, lasts

just a second or two. Correcting decoding errors consistently is important in helping your students build strong reading habits and reducing the transaction cost

of your corrections is arguably the most important factor in your success—not just in improving students’ decoding skills but in ensuring a successful **lesson**

overall. Except in cases where your **lesson** objective focuses on decoding skills, you should strive for the lowest possible transaction cost in making corrections.

This requires rigorous economy of language. Consider these two corrections of a student’s decoding error:

****Teacher**** 1: You said in-SPEAK-tion. Can you go back to the beginning of the sentence and read that word again?

****Teacher**** 2: In-SPEAK-tion? The difference between these corrections may seem trivial but is in fact huge.

Time how long it takes you to say each of these statements aloud. The time it takes to say the ﬁrst phrase—the transaction cost—is at least ﬁve times greater

than the transaction cost of the second. Every extra word the ﬁrst teacher says takes time and disrupts the ﬂow of student concentration on the story. Thus, every

extra word potentially disrupts comprehension. If you used the second phrase to correct, you could make three or four interventions in the time you could make

just one with the ﬁrst phrase. While you should correct consistently to **help** students decode effectively, doing so quickly and seamlessly is the only way

to make correction viable. Like the second teacher, you should strive to make a habit of using the simplest and quickest intervention. If you are consistent in

the manner that you do so, your students will get in the habit of self-correcting quickly and efﬁciently.

Two of the most efﬁcient correction methods in terms of transaction cost are “punch the error” (quickly repeating the misread word back to the student while

inﬂecting your voice to make it a question) and “mark the spot” (rereading the Teach Like a Champion

three or four words prior to the word on which the student made the error, and inﬂecting your voice to show that the student should continue the reading from

the point where you stop). An echo correction makes for a very low transaction cost, but as I have noted,

it does not ask the student to decode. Echo corrections may be worthwhile when you’re reading an especially important section of a text and can’t afford even

a minimal distraction. Otherwise, these corrections are best for sight words that defy the rules and logic of decoding.

Address Decoding Errors Even When Students ‘‘Know’’ the Rule A certain proportion of reading errors are due to carelessness, haste, or sloppy

reading habits. For example, some students habitually leave the s or other ending sounds off words, even though they know they are supposed to read them. These

errors remain important to correct nonetheless. They still interfere with compre- hension and, to paraphrase Mark Twain, the student who does not read words

correctly has little advantage over the student who cannot read them correctly. This is yet another argument for lowering your transaction cost: in many cases,

the key part is not so much the added information as the reminder to go back and reread more carefully, an important habit to build.

Techniques for Addressing Decoding Errors Observing champion reading teachers in action has allowed me to develop what

I hope is a clear and actionable list of the speciﬁc methods they use most often in correcting decoding errors. These methods allow you to correct errors con-

sistently, with a minimal transaction cost, and in a manner that causes students to self-correct. Because these approaches are all relatively straightforward, you

should be able to do them reliably and consistently with just a little bit of practice.

In many cases, the examples of various correction techniques provided in this section are wordier (they have a higher transaction cost) than they would

be in actual classroom use. I’ve done this to make them clearer, but teachers should always strive to streamline. In the two examples, in Punch the Error,

which follows, I encourage dropping the phrases, “Can you get the last part?” and “Try it again,” as soon as students come to understand that those parts of

the directions are implicit. The Fundamentals 267

Punch the Error •

Repeat the word a student misread back to him or her, replicating and putting emphasis on the part where the error occurred. Examples: “Is that word

in-SPEEK-tion??” “CARE-pet??” •

After a student makes a decoding error, repeat or describe the part of the word he or she read correctly. Examples: “You got the ﬁrst two sounds.” “Express is

right. Can you get the last part?” •

Sometimes students get the right sounds in the wrong order. Punch this error by identifying the correct order of sounds. Example: “The i comes before

the r. Try it again.” Mark the Spot

• Reread the three or four words immediately prior to the word on which the

student was unable to decode, inﬂecting your voice (usually by extending the last syllable or two of the last word) to show that the student should pick up

there. Example: When the student reads, “He ran though the door,” the teacher corrects with, “He ran . . . ”

Name the Sound •

Name the sound a letter should make, and ask students to repeat and apply it. •

Identify the sound a vowel is making, especially whether it is making a long or short sound, and ask students to apply it. Examples: “[That’s a]

long a.” “Long vowels say their name.” “Read that again: a long a.” •

Identify the sound a consonant is making, especially whether a C, G, or S is making a hard or soft sound, and ask the student to apply it.

Examples: “[That’s a] soft c.” “Hard c like cat/soft c like city.” “Hard g like golf/soft g like gym.”

• Name the sound a group of letters is making, and ask students to repeat and

apply. Examples: “-TCH says ‘chuh’ ” [with the **instruction** to try again under- stood]. “-EA says ‘ay.’ ”

• If there’s a clear and identiﬁable rule, remind students of it, and ask them to

apply it. Examples: “E at the end makes the vowel says its name.” “Silent E makes that a long a.”

Teach Like a Champion •

Here are the most common rules that every teacher should be prepared to reinforce:

• Long vowels: In a long vowel sound, a letter says its name (e.g., the

a in cape). With the exception of times when they’re followed by the letter r, long vowel sounds are very consistent. You should be able to

prompt students with: “Long e” and have them self-correct. •

Short vowels: In a short vowel sound, a letter says something, well, shorter than its long form (e.g., the a in cap). With the exception of times

when they’re followed by the letter r, short vowel sounds are consistent (almost as consistent as long vowels). You should be able to prompt

students with: “Short e” and have them self-correct. •

Silent e (makes the vowel say its name): When a word’s pattern is vowel- consonant-e, the e is almost always silent and the preceding vowel is

long (says its name). You should be able to prompt students “Silent e” (or “Tricky e”) and have them self-correct.

• Bossy r (makes her ﬁrst car turn): Vowels followed by r usually make

their own sound—distinct from the long or short sound and often similar to other “r-controlled” vowel sounds. The sounds in ﬁrst and turn are the

same; the a in car isn’t short or long! ou should be able to prompt students to remember “bossy r” and have them self-correct.

• Soft/hard C: Hard c says car. Soft c says cent. You should be able to

prompt students “Soft c” (or “Hard c”) and have them self-correct. •

Soft/hard G: Hard g says gas. Soft g says gentleman. You should be able to prompt students “Soft g”(or “Hard g”) and have them self-correct.

• -tion says shun: You should be able to prompt students “-tion says shun”

and have them self-correct. •

-ight says ite: You should be able to prompt students “-ight says ite” and have them self-correct.

• -igh says I: You should be able to prompt students “-igh says I ” and have

them self-correct. •

Slyly: When a word ends in –y, it most often makes an i sound if the word is one syllable and an e sound if it has multiple syllables. Think

dry and democracy or sly and slyly. Because it contains both, use slyly as your cue. You should be able to prompt students slyly and have them

self-correct. The Fundamentals 269

• Give the student a more familiar example of a troubling letter sequence from

which to model. Example: For a student struggling to read the word would: “You know could, so this must be . . . ?”

Chunk It •

Help students chunk difﬁcult words by recognizing familiar patterns and words-within-words. Examples: If a student struggles to read the word hope-

less: “Do you see a part of that you already know?” “The ﬁrst four letters are a word you know.” “Cover the ‘–less,’ and read what you have.”

• Afﬁrm and reiterate what the student got right, focusing him on the problem

chunk. Example: “You got hope, but the second part isn’t ‘-ing.’ ” •

Ask students to read a confusing word without a sufﬁx or preﬁx ﬁrst. Example: “ ‘Re’– is a preﬁx. Try reading the word without it. Cover up the r and the e.

Now what do you have?” Speed the Exceptions

• When a word does not conform to standard rules, identify the correct pro-

nunciation quickly and directly. Example: “That word is written ‘bury’ but pronounced ‘berry.’ We’ll just have to remember it.” “That word is through.”

• If a student should know a word’s distinctive pronunciation (it is a sight word

or has recently been discussed), quickly identify it as an exception. Example: “That’s one of our sight words.” “That word doesn’t follow the rules, but we

studied it yesterday.” •

If there’s a speciﬁc rule the word breaks, identify that rule if you can to make the reasoning clear. Example: “We’d expect the e to make that I say “g-IVE”

[as in hive] but this word is an exception.” It’s also important to use quick and simple positive reinforcement when

students read a word correctly not only because it encourages them but it also lets them know explicitly that they got it right. Since correction of mispronunciation

and misreading is inconsistent at best in their lives, they may not know when they’ve gotten a word correct. As students continue reading, say “yup,” “perfect,”

“you got it,” “nice,” and so on. You can also increase efﬁciency by reducing the amount of time students spend pausing and wondering whether they’ve gotten a

tough word correct. Obviously you want this method to speed, not slow, your Teach Like a Champion

reading. You can minimize your transaction costs by making the phrases you use to reinforce both quick and consistent (too much variation draws too much

**attention** to your words). Cueing Systems

Good readers often begin to read a word incorrectly but arrive at the right pro- nunciation by using knowledge of letters and sounds, grammar and syntax, and

context to develop plausible options. Experts call these cueing systems because they are three separate ways students infer information about words.

Experienced teachers and reading specialists should carefully encourage stu- dents to use and develop these cueing systems to address decoding errors:

Letter and Sound Cueing Text reads: “The dog growls.”

****Student**** reads: “The dog barks.” ****Teacher**** says: “If it was bark, there would be a b at the beginning. [pointing to

the letter g] Is this a b?” Grammar and Syntax Cueing

Text reads: “The boys wore their coats.” ****Student**** reads: “The boys wore their coat.”

****Teacher**** says: “The boys all shared one coat? Is that correct?” Although using students’ knowledge of grammar and syntax can be useful,

teachers should avoid instructing students to use what “sounds right” since what sounds right to readers who have not internalized standard rules of grammar is

unreliable at best. Meaning and Context Cueing

Text reads: “Clowns wear makeup and fake noses.” ****Student**** reads: “Clowns wear makeup and face noses.”

****Teacher**** says: “Does it makes sense that they would wear face noses?” Poor readers often rely excessively on meaning and context cueing systems.

Be careful not to encourage them to rely exclusively on techniques that do not reinforce actual letter and sound decoding.

The Fundamentals 271

# ****Vocabulary****

Students need a rich vocabulary to understand what they read, and the importance

of word knowledge is redoubled by the fact that, as E. D. Hirsch, whose books on cultural literacy led to the founding of the Core Knowledge program, points out

its effect compounds over time. Whether a student learns the word taiga as she’s reading a passage about subarctic climates may depend in part on whether she

knows what tundra means. In his book The Knowledge Deﬁcit, Hirsch describes this as a Matthew effect. Simply put with vocabulary, the rich get richer and the

poor get poorer. The term was ﬁrst coined by sociologist Robert K. Merton in 1968 and takes its name from a line in the biblical Gospel of Matthew:

For to all those who have, more will be given, and they will have an abundance; but from those who have nothing, even what they have will be taken away.

Students who know more words learn more words. In fact, research suggests that a ten-thousand-word vocabulary gap exists between students of privilege

and students from less advantaged backgrounds by the time they reach tenth grade. This disparity in and of itself may account for a signiﬁcant part of the

learning gap. But while teaching vocabulary is critically important, all types of teaching

vocabulary are not equal. Good vocabulary **instruction** starts with a student- friendly deﬁnition that’s simple and clear. While some teachers believe that

arriving at the deﬁnition is the goal of vocabulary work, champion teachers start there and spend their time having students practice using words widely and richly

after they know the basic meaning. They recognize that knowing a deﬁnition is a long way from being able to use a word effectively in writing or thought. They

recognize that it is more powerful to ask students, “How would you use it?” When would you use it?” or “How is it different from [a similar word]?” than

to guess, “What do you think that might mean?” In fact, a correct guess may be a dangerous false positive, suggesting that a student knows what a word

means, when in reality, she understands it only at the most basic, and therefore insufﬁcient, level.

Many teachers also use a synonym model in teaching vocabulary: deﬁning a word by ﬁnding a viable synonym. This technique has critical ﬂaws, how-

ever (Bringing Words to Life: Robust ****Vocabulary**** ****Instruction**** by Isabel L. Beck, Margaret G. McKeown, and Linda Kucan). Even if two words overlap signiﬁ-

cantly in their meaning, they are not the same, and it is the difference between the two that matters. Consider mimic and imitate, two words that might be taught as

synonyms. Mimicry usually implies mocking, often for humorous effect, while Teach Like a Champion

imitation can be neutral or negative. However, even when negative, it implies something cheap and not the derisive sense that mimic carries. This difference

accounts for a disproportionately large share of the meaning either word con- tributes to a written passage. A scene in which Billy mimics his teacher makes

for a very different story than does one in which he imitates her. A student who sees these words as interchangeable misses that critical difference not just in the

words but in the passage as well. ****Teaching**** deep word knowledge means helping students understand how a word is similar to and different from similar words,

and it unlocks shades of meaning in the author’s word choice. That is, focusing on difference prepares students to use vocabulary functionally and increase their

reading comprehension. Although the skill of inferring vocabulary from context appears frequently

on state assessments, teaching vocabulary primarily by context clues is also far less effective in the long run. Contexts can be vague, nondirective, or misdirec-

tive. Even if students learn to infer word meaning correctly much of the time, they are still essentially making guesses, and often erroneous ones at that. More

signiﬁcant, deep word knowledge, a better predictor of achievement than broad word knowledge, can rarely be grasped from context-based **instruction**. Strong

vocabulary must be systematically and directly taught. Finally, since good vocabulary **instruction** requires a signiﬁcant investment

of time, choices of which words to invest in are important. Some words are more worthy of investment than others. Generally teachers should invest time in

teaching tier 2 words, which are relevant to student’s lives, likely to appear again, and respond well to **instruction**. Tier 1 words such as awesome and cafeteria

are basic words that students at a given grade level should know. They appear frequently in oral rather than written language and are too common or easy to

warrant signiﬁcant investment of a teacher’s time. Tier 3 words such as microbe and piccolo have a low frequency of use, and they tend to be used in speciﬁc

domains. They are less worthy of investment because they are least likely to appear again in other parts of a student’s life.

If there are too many tier 2 words to teach (there often are), invest in words that relate best to what you’re teaching (either the **content** of what you’re reading

or other vocabulary words). If you’re reading a passage on the Civil War, hostility might be especially useful (and memorable). If you’re reading a novel about

social class, the word digniﬁed might be a strong choice. And teaching digniﬁed might make a strong case for including words like haughty and aspire since they

could be compared, contrasted, and used as a group, making the whole larger than sum of their parts.

The Fundamentals 273 Since

the approach

described here

involves intentional

teaching of

vocabulary—that is, teaching words regularly, consistently, and often before (or even regardless of whether) they come up in an authentic text—it’s worth

looking at a possible road map for introducing vocabulary words. Six Techniques to Reinforce Strong ****Vocabulary****

Observing champion reading teachers in action has allowed me to develop what I hope is a clear and actionable list of the speciﬁc methods they use to reinforce

vocabulary, especially depth of word knowledge. These methods allow you to reinforce word knowledge, in a variety of settings. Because these approaches

are all relatively straightforward, you should be able to do them reliably and consistently with just a little bit of practice.

1. Multiple takes. To enter a word into their functioning memory, students need to hear a word (and ideally its pronunciation) multiple times. Try to get

them myriad quick exposures after introducing a word. •

Have students practice using a word in different settings and situations and give an example of a time when they might use it.

• “What animal would you most want for a companion?”

• “What’s the most nutritious thing you’ve eaten today?”

• “Can you think of a character in a movie or on TV who wears a

disguise?” •

“When would it be especially important to be precise?” •

Circle back to words you previously taught—yesterday, last week, or last month.

• “Who can recall a vocabulary word we’ve studied this month that means

not having enough of something?” •

Give students a sentence stem with a vocabulary word, and ask them to ﬁnish it.

• “My mother stared at me with astonishment; she never imagined

that . . . ” •

Have students practice saying words correctly. •

“That word is pronounced ‘FLOO-Id.’ Everybody say that.” •

“What vocabulary word did we have that can refer to a liquid?” Teach Like a Champion

2. Compare, combine, contrast. Beware the “synonym model.” It’s the difference between similar words that creates meaning in a passage.

• Ask students to distinguish between or compare two different words; focus

on nuances of meaning. “Can anyone describe how indifferent is different from apathetic?”

• Ask students to describe how and whether they could combine vocabulary

words. “Could a tyrant ever be humble?”

“What **kind** of disguise could be vibrant?” •

Ask students to apply and discuss a change (ideally to a similar word). “How would the meaning of what Mr. Beasley said change if he used

the word furious?” “How would it make James different if he mimicked Sue instead of

imitating her?” “What does mimic have in common with spiteful?”

3. Upgrade. Find opportunities to use richer and more speciﬁc words when- ever possible.

• Ask students to use recently introduced words in class discussions.

“We have a vocabulary word for weather that’s hot and damp. Can you use it?”

“Who can summarize the ﬁrst chapter using the word desolate?” •

Ask explicitly for a better word. “Can you use a better word than big?”

“James is upset when he’s speaking. Let me hear me hear you describe how he talked with a better word than said.”

4. Stress the syntax. Students often struggle to use new words in different settings. They know inadvertent but can’t turn it onto inadvertently. They say,

“I am feeling inadvertent.” •

Ask students to identify or change a word’s part of speech. “What part of speech is stride here, Susan?”

“Can you use stride as a noun instead?” “How would I make inadvertent an adverb?”

The Fundamentals 275 •

Ask students to identify or change a word’s tense. “Can you think of a sentence that uses cower in the past tense?”

“Can you put that sentence in the third person?” 5. Back to roots. Stress the foundational knowledge of roots so students can

apply their understanding to new words. •

Ask students to identify roots or afﬁxes and describe how they relate to meaning.

“Why is the root ped- in the word pedestrian?” “What might monolith and lithograph have to do with a stone?”

• Ask students to identify other words containing a root.

“Telepathy is sending or reading thoughts and feelings from far away. What other tele- words have ‘far away’ in their meaning?”

6. Picture this. Create a multidimensional image of each new word by using pictures and actions.

• Help students visualize words by giving them a picture that exempliﬁes a

word they’ve learned. Or have students draw their own picture of a word. •

Ask students to act out or personify a word. “Show me what you would look like if you were furious.”

“Who can swagger across the room?” •

Have students develop gestures to **help** them remember words. Give them the word, and ask for the gesture. Give them the gesture, and have them provide

the word. Example: For the word idyllic, students skip once to signify skip- ping through the woods, an exaggeratedly idyllic way to spend an afternoon.

****Vocabulary**** Methods for Specialists ****Reading**** and language arts teachers take on the additional challenge of introduc-

ing vocabulary **instruction** more systematically into their classes. Teachers at one high-performing middle school use the following sequence to introduce vocabu-

lary words. It applies many of the techniques above and requires ten to ﬁfteen minutes at the outset of each class to teach one or two new words as follows:

1. Provide the deﬁnition and part of speech of a new vocabulary word.

2. Provide a similar word, ideally one with which students are familiar, and

explain how the vocabulary word is similar but different. Have students sug- gest times when they might use the word in question and why.

Teach Like a Champion 3.

Show students a picture that portrays the vocabulary word. Explain why the picture is a representation of the word.

4. Create a sentence, written by the class with your guidance, that reﬂects the

word’s meaning in a complete thought. 5.

# Fluency

In the standard deﬁnition, ﬂuency consists of automaticity (the ability to read at

a rapid rate without error) and expression (the ability to group words together into phrases to reﬂect meaning, emphasize important words, and express tone

and register). You could argue, however, that ﬂuency consists of automaticity plus expression plus comprehension. That is, to read a text expressively, the

reader has to comprehend it. What are the register, tone, and mood like? Which words deserve special emphasis? How does the punctuation shape the meaning?

In short, ﬂuency isn’t more than fast reading; it’s reading with the meaning made audible.

True expressive and ﬂuent reading demonstrates comprehension—in some cases, more efﬁciently than talking about or describing that understanding. It

embeds the understanding in the action of ﬂuent reading. And while many teach- ers think of ﬂuency as a skill that’s most relevant in the elementary grades,

the opposite may be true. Developing students’ ability to comprehend the full amount of information carried within the text relies on an “expressive ear” that

can extract meaning from subtext, tone, register, innuendo, and analogy. Mature books rely even more heavily for their meaning on the portion of the argument

carried by these subtextual elements. Unlocking those forms of meaning must be continually practiced and modeled even, and especially, in the later years.

The best way to truly understand Shakespeare, experts will tell you, is to read it aloud. And of course the other key to understanding Shakespeare—or any other

text—is to be able to read it quickly and efﬁciently and with sufﬁcient brain cells left over for thinking about things other than what the words were.

The Fundamentals 277 Four Techniques to Reinforce Strong Fluency

Observing champion reading teachers in action has allowed me to develop what I hope is a clear and actionable list of the speciﬁc methods they use most often

to reinforce ﬂuent and expressive reading. These methods allow you to reinforce both automaticity and comprehension in a way that most students will ﬁnd enjoy-

able. Because these approaches are all relatively straightforward, you should be able to do them reliably and consistently with just a little bit of practice.

• Show some spunk. Read aloud to your students regularly. When you do, model strong reading and expressive emphasis. This may involve some risk

taking—if you’re not inclined to drama—but not only will you show them how to unlock the expressive parts of language, you’ll make it safe for them to take

the risk of reading with spirit and vigor. This is equally important whether you are reading War and Peace, Owl at Home, “A Summary of the Oxygen Cycle,”

or the directions to a word problem. In fact, students may be least familiar with how to extract meaning from the last two examples and thus may get the most

out of hearing those read aloud. A particularly important time to show some spunk is at the start of a longer

section of oral reading or when starting up again after a break for discussion. ****Reading**** the ﬁrst few sentences yourself models expressiveness, normalizing it

and helping to sustain and engage interest in the text by getting it off to an exciting start. The verve and energy you bring to oral reading will be modeled

in your student’s oral (and silent) reading. Talking about modeling effective reading raises questions, however, about

what to model and how. Here are two thoughts. The ﬁrst is to group the words. ****Reading**** is like making music. The notes and rests have different lengths, both

in how they are written and in the subtleties of how they are played. In the sentence, “****Reading**** is like making music,” for example, the words making and

music run together slightly more than the other words for most readers. Readers tend to group those words for emphasis and rhythm, and the sentence’s meaning

shifts subtly as a result. As with music, some of the meaning is made visible by punctuation; other aspects are less obvious. When you read, **help** students

recognize how the music in reading is played by grouping consciously. Seek to model stringing words together in ﬂuid groups—the longer the better. For

example, look for words in prepositional phrases to stick together, for a drop in the voice, and a slight acceleration for a parenthetical.

Another technique to follow in modeling oral reading is to identify especially important words in a passage and emphasize them. One beneﬁt of this technique is

Teach Like a Champion that when students implement it, they are required to engage their full intellectual

faculties in deciding what words are in fact most important. Their choices present a fruitful topic for discussion and a valuable source of data about their reading.

One Shakespearean expert I know proposed that the best way to read the Bard is to ﬁnd and emphasize contrast words and emphasize the tension between

them as you read. You can start students off more simply by having them look for transition words (after, instead, suddenly) and comparative and superlatives

(darker, faster, saddest, fullest) to emphasize. • Ask for some drama. Just as your reading expressively is good for stu-

dents, so too is asking students to read expressively. It forces them to practice looking for the depth of meaning in words. To make oral reading more system-

atically expressive, try the following: •

Identify (by telling students or helping them to infer it) the **kind** of expression your students should impart to the passage and ask them to apply it. “Wilbur

is upset, Diamond. Can you read that sentence in a way that shows that?” You could also ask students to ﬁrst infer Wilbur’s mood and then ask them

to model: “How is Wilbur feeling right now? What emotion is he feeling? Good. Can you show me that?”

• Call students’ **attention** to dialogue tags and their role as “stage directions.”

“The passage says, ‘ “I don’t want any,” Mr. Malone said sharply.’ Read that again so his words are sharp.” You can make this technique even more

effective by modeling the applicable tone when you read the dialogue tag and asking students to apply it to the sentence they are reading. In other

words, in the example, you would say the word sharply in a sharp tone of voice that students could mimic and apply to the sentence.

• Ask students to identify the two or three most important words in a sentence

(or the two or three most important ideas in a passage) and place special emphasis on them.

• Ask students to add to or extract something particular to or from the text

by choosing a key descriptive word from the surrounding passage or even a vocabulary word and asking students to read the passage in a way that

emphasized that word. For example, in a **lesson** at Excellence Charter ****School**** in Brooklyn, third-grade teacher Roberto de Leon responded to a student’s

reading of a passage from Phantom of the Opera by saying, “Stop. Repeat that line, and read it as though he wanted to make her obey him.” Obey was

one of the classes vocabulary words, and as he gave this **instruction**, de Leon The Fundamentals 279

held up a note card with obey written on it. The student reread the passage focusing on incorporating the emphasis that de Leon suggested. In another

example, a teacher asked her students to read aloud from a scene in C. S. Lewis’s Prince Caspian. After the ﬁrst reading, she noted, “Look back a

few sentences. It says the children are feeling gloomy as they sit and wait for the train. Can you read that again to show that the children are gloomy?”

Obviously it can be especially rigorous when your line of questioning forces students to infer what tone or mood the words should carry from subtler

clues. “Who can tell Danielle what **kind** of tone to use in reading these lines? Why do you say that?” You might even add, “Did everyone read it

that way?” before asking Danielle to model the tone in her reading. •

Ask students to provide other possible interpretations of a line that a student read. De Leon is a master of this. “Oh, I love it!” he replied to a student’s

expressive reading. “Who else wants to read that line expressively? Maybe in a slightly different way?”

In clip 23 on the DVD, Roberto de Leon of Excellence Charter ****School**** of

Bedford Stuyvesant demonstrates exemplary teaching of ﬂuency. He begins this inspirational clip by using the oral cloze technique from Control the

Game to test for leverage. He quickly ﬁnds he needs to restart to ensure that his students are not just listening but reading along with him (or a

student reader). From here it’s all ﬂuency. De Leon demonstrates Show Some Spunk by modeling for his students

the **kind** of expressive reading that embeds meaning and shows compre- hension. Notice how effective his pass-off is to the student who reads with

the mask. Roberto models the tone of the letter he asks the student to read with the ﬁrst two words and then passes off to his student midsentence.

The student can now practice applying the tone Roberto has set to his own reading simply by trying to continue it—something the student does

extremely successfully. The student probably wouldn’t have taken the risk of reading so expressively if de Leon hadn’t done so himself ﬁrst. Show

Teach Like a Champion Some Spunk and Ask for Some Drama are permanently and inherently

connected! Finally, notice the way Roberto uses Lather, Rinse, Repeat so effectively,

embedding it within lots of positive feedback but asking the student to reread with a new emphasis: embedding the application of the vocabulary

word obey. In this clip, de Leon is both developing his students’ reading ear and

teaching them to use their reading to demonstrate comprehension. This in turn will make his evaluation of their comprehension more efﬁcient. He’ll

be able to hear it. • Check the mechanics. Students may see punctuation but not grasp what it

is telling them to do in terms of meaning or inﬂection. Make explicit reference to punctuation, and ask students to demonstrate their understanding of it in their oral

reading. “There’s a period there. Did you stop?” “I want you to pause and breathe whenever you see a comma.” “Someone is talking there, right?” Emphasize the

importance of syntax—the relationship of the pieces of a sentence and its effect on meaning, which is often lost on weak readers—and the idea that though

sets the rest of the sentence in contrast to the initial phrase is a critical part of effective reading. Ask students to identify which words told them a sentence was

a question or which words told them that the two men were not alike. • Lather, rinse, repeat. Don’t just have students read frequently; have

them reread frequently. Once students have made basic sense of the words in a sentence, ask them to go back and reread speciﬁcally for ﬂuency. Here are three

particular reasons for a reread: •

To smooth out an original read that was wooden or required mechanical correction. “Okay, now that you’ve got the words, let’s go back and read it

with energy. This is an exciting part of the book!” •

To emphasize some aspect of meaning or incorporate feedback. “Okay, good. Now read that sentence [or passage] again, and try to show how scared they

are.” “Can you go back and put special emphasis on the words that show the boys are scared?”

• For fun or because the original read was especially good. “Oh that was great!

Can you read it again so we can all hear how surly you made it sound?” The Fundamentals 281

constructive feedback. Lofthus asks her student to read the passage again because he showed ‘‘fantastic expression,’’ both celebrating and analyzing

# ****Comprehension**** ****Teaching**** Students to Understand What They Read 

****Comprehension****—understanding a text’s full meaning and relevance—is the

ultimate aim of reading. ****Comprehension**** is often difﬁcult to teach directly, how- ever, because it encompasses so much and relies on so many different skills. Still,

one theme reﬂected in this chapter is the importance of testing the assumption that when students cannot answer questions that test an understanding of a text’s

full meaning and relevance, the problem is that they don’t grasp the broader concepts those questions directly address. In fact, many times students cannot

answer deeper questions not because they don’t know how to think in a broad or abstract manner but because they failed to understand what they read fully and

are trying to make cognitive leaps from a faulty base of underlying knowledge. Champion teachers, I have observed, do ask rigorous and challenging ques-

tions to assess students’ knowledge of a text’s full meaning and relevance, but they also put intensive focus on often unacknowledged barriers to comprehension.

Word- and phrase-level questions are a prime example. Failure to understand colloquial expressions and phrases or the syntax of a complex sentence (who,

for example, a certain pronoun refers back to) is common among students who arrive in class with underdeveloped language skills. Therefore asking

questions like “Who’s ‘he’ in that sentence?” or “What does the author mean when she writes that Harry ‘ﬂashed his teeth,’ and what does that tell you

about him?” are effective questions not just for ensuring solid comprehension of basic facts in a passage but because they are necessary to higher-level

Teach Like a Champion comprehension. In a key scene in C. S. Lewis’s The Lion, the Witch and the

Wardrobe, for example, Aslan, the heroic lion, “turns on” the witch. A reader who fails to understand that to “turn on” someone means to do more than to

turn around but to do so with the intent to attack will miss the building tension in the scene and fail to understand it. I am not arguing for an exclusive focus

on word- and phrase-level questions but for the recognition that such questions are as necessary to understanding gaps in student comprehension as broader and

deeper questions that appear to better assess their knowledge of the big picture. In a nutshell, the assumption

that’s broken down by watching champion teachers

in action is the idea that **instruction** that teaches

comprehension skills should necessarily look like

**instruction** that relies on those skills once established.

In a nutshell, the assumption that’s broken down by watching champion

teachers in action is the idea that instruc- tion that teaches comprehension skills

should necessarily look like **instruction** that relies on those skills once estab-

lished. This challenge is exacerbated by the fact that so many of us became accli-

mated to teaching that relies on estab- lished comprehension skills in college

(and often high school). Its look and feel have been normalized for us and

literature classes have replaced reading classes in our minds’ eye. As a result, many teachers skip over steps like con-

ﬁrming understanding of key phrases and events in a test in order to get to “deeper” conversations about a book’s place in the world on the assumption that

the latter discussions are more rigorous. However, this is not necessarily true, as classrooms that build strong comprehension skills rather than using them to

engage in interpretation maintain higher standards for the use of evidence to support opinions, for example.

# Techniques for building comprehension

I’ve described some of the key methods champion teachers use and adapt to teach

comprehension following. I’ve grouped them into three categories according to when in the reading process they take place: before, during, or after reading.

Prereading Techniques Top reading teachers often begin the reading process by preteaching students

critical facts and context they’ll need to understand in order to make sense of the text they’re about to read. If students don’t really know what a Nazi is when

****Comprehension**** 285 they start reading, they’re not going to get what they need to out of Number

the Stars or Diary of Anne Frank. Preteaching background material is usually more efﬁcient than stopping and providing explanation and detail during reading

because it prevents misunderstandings before they crop up rather than remediating them afterward. Although the argument for preteaching seems self-evident, the

manner in which top teachers approach it is distinct from what’s often “typical,” and informed by a greater emphasis on efﬁciency and intentionality.

For example, when I was ﬁrst teaching, we were socialized, as many teachers are today, to coax contextual information out of students with KWL charts. We

would list in two columns (1) things students said they already knew and (2) things they said they wanted to learn. The “Things I Know” column, I came

to realize, asked students to make unsubstantiated guesses about the things they knew least about or led to our developing a wide-ranging list of “facts” of

varying degrees of importance and accuracy. The “Want to Know” column was similarly grounded in lack of knowledge—often idiosyncratic or distracting from

the things that were most important for students to master and many of which would never be addressed, causing me to play a shell game of pretending to

be open to talking about whatever my students wanted when this was illogical and impossible. I found with some relief, then, that observation of top teachers

suggested the power of delivering the necessary preliminary information in a direct, clear, and organized manner at the outset and saving the earnest list of what

I want to understand for during and after the reading. Ten minutes of teacher- driven background and then getting right to reading is usually worth an hour of,

“Who can tell me what Nazis were?” Efﬁciency matters. The tricky part lies so much in the background knowledge you know your

students will lack but the knowledge they lack that you may not realize. We’ve probably all experienced a version of this. We sweep a text for tricky vocabulary

words before reading it with a class, for example, only to ﬁnd on teaching it that a word we missed (once, twice, even several times during planning) is an

obvious barrier to comprehension. In retrospect we ask: How could I have failed to see that? And of course the same thing happens with other forms of important

prior knowledge. We don’t always recognize the places where our students’ gaps exist. You know they won’t know what a Nazi was but don’t realize that they

know almost nothing about World War II, or the proximity and relative size of Denmark and Germany, or that Danes and Germans don’t speak the same

language. What follows are some ways to ensure that prereading sets the most powerful

basis for knowledge possible. Teach Like a Champion

Contexting The most basic approach to helping students comprehend a text is

to give them context on it—to take them methodically through key information that will **help** them enter into it as informed readers, for example, what they

need to know about history or science or baseball or Japan to follow the action. Contexting can take place before the introduction of a text or before reading a

speciﬁc section, a chapter, say, as Lisa Delfavero of Rochester Prep recently did in preparing her ﬁfth-graders to read one of the key scenes in Gary Paulsen’s

novel Hatchet. Lisa led off by showing her students three or four slides of a moose with full antlers. “I don’t want to give too much away but it will be

important for you to understand how ﬁerce and intimidating a moose can be,” she said. She wisely recognized that her students, many of whom had never left

Rochester, would need that context to understand the key scene (a standoff with a moose) and accomplished the task in less than thirty seconds.

Top teachers strive for efﬁciency in their contexting, delivering the informa- tion directly and letting the experience of the book yield the deeper engagement.

At the same time they are aggressive about ﬁnding and addressing areas where contexting might work. As E. D. Hirsch has pointed out, lack of prior knowl-

edge is one of the key barriers to comprehension for at-risk students and it affects all aspects of reading, even ﬂuency and decoding, as struggling with

gaps soaks up the brain’s processing capacity. “Prior knowledge about the topic speeds up basic comprehension and leaves working memory free to make con-

nections between the new material and previously learned information, to draw inferences, and to ponder implications. A big difference between an expert and

a novice reader—indeed between an expert and a novice in any ﬁeld—is the ability to take in basic features very fast, thereby leaving the mind free to con-

centrate on important features” (“****Reading**** ****Comprehension**** Requires Knowledge of Words and the World,” America Educator, Spring 2003, p. 13).

Focal Points ****Reading**** a rich text is like visiting a state fair or perhaps a circus,

with action in every direction and full of sensory detail, voices, events, and images—maybe too many, in fact, for a reader to attend to them all. By college

or even the latter years of high school, many of us ﬁnd this to be the exciting part of interpretation, with each reader uncovering a unique version of events or

focusing on different events in arriving at a different meaning. Many teachers therefore model their classes on approaches to meaning similar

to the ones they enjoyed so much in college. However, this aspect of reading often poses a challenge to developing readers. You learn to determine what’s worthy

of **attention** only with time and practice. Without years of practice, readers often ****Comprehension**** 287

make questionable or nonstrategic decisions about what to attend to. They notice something of tangential relevance but miss the crucial moment. The trapeze artists

are in full swing, and they can’t stop looking at the cotton candy seller. They see three details but fail to connect them to one another.

To **help** students manage the complexity of a text, champion teachers steer them in advance toward key ideas, concepts, and themes to look for. Which

characters will turn out to be most important? What idea will be most relevant to the story discussion? In addition, they advise students what’s secondary, not

that important, or can be ignored for now. “There’s a lot of discussion of their clothing. That would have told us a lot about them in the eighteenth century, but

we’re not going worry too much about it.” In a **lesson** I observed, a teacher read the short story “The Substitute” by

David Lubar with her ﬁfth graders. The story’s ending is both unexpected and requires a signiﬁcant inference to understand. As and even before she read, the

teacher began calling students’ **attention** to key lines and details that would **help** them understand the end when it arrived: “The word conductivity is going to

be very important to understanding what happens in the story, so let’s deﬁne it carefully now.” “Ooh, that line is extra-important. Let’s underline it. The fact that

he was picked on by his students is going to prove very important in the end.” By the time her students arrived at the ﬁnale, they didn’t know what the surprise

would be, but they had paid special **attention** to the key pieces of evidence and were fully prepared to make the inference that comprehending the story required.

In a **lesson** in his third grade classroom at Excellence Charter ****School**** of Bedford Stuyvesant, Rob de Leon set his students up for their study of Akimbo

and the Elephants with an elegant introduction that used focal points on several levels. First Rob told his students to get ready to be surprised by the book. “One

of the things you’ll ﬁnd about great books as you read them all your life is that they change your thinking,” he told them. “This book is going to change your

thinking about elephants, about poachers, and about the idea of bravery.” Then to accentuate not only a theme like bravery but also their own change of opinions,

he asked them to write answers to a few quick prereading questions that forced them to state their opinions about issues raised in the book (e.g., “True or false: it

is acceptable to take any paying job to feed your family, even if it hurts animals”) so they could track their own changing perceptions as they read.

Front-loading In addition to introducing key ideas in advance of students read-

ing them, the best teachers introduce key scenes before their students read them, much like movie studios make sure their multimillion-dollar bets pay off by

Teach Like a Champion prescreens for us in the form of previews, a series of exciting, fascinating, mys-

terious, or otherwise intriguing scenes from the movie. The scenes they show aren’t always in narrative order. They are often quick and disconnected, designed

to excite our interest and awaken suspense rather than offer a logical pr´ecis of the story to come. They front-load our exposure to critical scenes so we feel

connected to the story before we begin and so we give special **attention** to those scenes when we come across them. We’ve been tipped off that they are espe-

cially dramatic and important. For a reading teacher front-loading scenes can also excite interest and increase comprehension by making the narrative seem more

familiar at key points. When you encounter a scene you’ve seen previewed in the midst of the movie and feel as if you’ve seen it before or recognize that it is

of primary importance, further meaning is unlocked in some of the same ways that seeing a movie or reading a text for the second or third time does.

As with a movie preview you don’t necessarily need to front-load in the same order scenes will appear in the book or even with full explanation; a little

mystery can **help** too. You goal is for your student, reading Macbeth for the ﬁrst time, to encounter the scene where Macbeth tries to wash the blood he imagines

on his hands and say, “Oh, here it is! My teacher told me about this scene!” and read it with special **attention**.

Here are a few examples of front-loading and focal points: •

“You’re going to meet just about the cleverest and nastiest crocodile you’ve ever seen. Not only is he surly and mean, but wait to you see him try to dis-

guise himself as a palm tree!” •

“For the rest of your life, you’ll hear people refer to the idea of having ‘blood on your hands,’ and they’ll mean not literal blood but the inescapable weight

of guilt. That expression, that idea, was coined by Shakespeare four hundred years ago in this play. So when you see Macbeth talking about the blood on his

hands, you’ll know that you’re reading a scene people have found unforget- table for centuries.”

• “There’s a big storm coming in this chapter. And the children are going to

be scared. But watch and see how Sarah reacts. It’s one of the moments that shows her character, so it’s very important.”

Prereading Summary Summarizing occurs before, after, and during reading.

I’ve included it here because it is especially effective as a jumping-off point ****Comprehension**** 289

for any given day’s reading to summarize the previous day’s. If you’re using your summary to quickly prepare students to read a new section of the text, try

combining questioning and narrative in a fast-paced summary. Start summarizing the reading yourself to cover key sections quickly. Stop at critical points and ask

students highly focused questions to ﬁll in the blanks: “So the two heroes ﬁght a bloody battle. And where do they ﬁght it, Janice? And who wins the battle,

Paul? And what happens to the loser, Steven?” Obviously these questions are not as rigorous or as in-depth as summary questions you might ask after reading,

but their purpose is different: to activate memory of prior reading. The narrative portions of these summaries are often especially effective when

they are quasi-dramatized in an energetic play-by-play that captures the thrill and energy of the original text by describing it in a tone that reﬂects the mood of the

events, that is, modeling excitement when summarizing sections when characters were excited and modeling anger when characters were angry.

Prereading in Action When reading teacher Dinah Shepherd at Roxbury Prep

in Boston prepared her students to encounter Animal Farm by reading an article on the Russian Revolution, she talked students through a basic understanding

of industrialization and communism (contexting). They talked brieﬂy about how the initial idealism of communist revolutions was quickly co-opted. Shepherd

directed her students to pay particular **attention** to the characteristics of Trotsky, Lenin, and Stalin since they would be portrayed, in allegory, in Animal Farm

(focal points). As she did this, she dropped in intriguing references to scenes from the book: “When you see the pigs walking around talking . . . when you see the

horse ﬂipping her mane with blue ribbons in her hair . . . , you’ll know this is no ordinary farm. That’s how you know this story is an allegory” (prescreening).

When her students began reading the novel, they did so with a keen sense of carefully honed anticipation.

During-****Reading**** Techniques Although an intentional approach to **instruction** before reading is critical to suc-

cess, the types of questions you ask while students are reading are of critical importance. It’s easy to assume that this importance should always mean asking

broad and abstract questions. Although such questions are important, champion teachers are diligent in maintaining a balanced approach to their questions.

Don’t Wait Among the most potent facts about top teachers is that they con-

stantly check for understanding by asking students questions to see if they “get Teach Like a Champion

it” frequently and throughout the passages they read. They read a few sentences or perhaps a few paragraphs and pause to ask a quick question or two, assessing

whether students are following the narrative and guarding against unexpected barriers to comprehension. Their questions are often relatively straightforward.

Did students absorb a key detail, make a key inference, understand a word? In asking they are careful to keep discussion limited. The goal in their questions is

in fact not to discuss but to conﬁrm understanding so students with additional thoughts are often asked to save them until a clearer discussion point.

Perhaps this sounds obvious, but watch enough **instruction** and you will frequently see teachers slog through a passage of several pages, holding their

questions for the end and never stopping to conﬁrm that students are still with them. An ancillary beneﬁt of Don’t Wait, by the way, is the fact that in allowing

you to recognize comprehension gaps as soon as they emerge, it allows you to gather better data about the root causes of your students’ comprehension difﬁ-

culties. If you waited until the end of a passage, you’d likely never know the source of the problem. What’s more, catching a misunderstanding is more effec-

tive as soon as it happens, in this case as soon as the sentence is misunderstood rather than several minutes later or even at the end of a paragraph and after three

subsequent sentences of misunderstanding have accrued. Asking questions every few sentences rather than waiting until the end of a selection accomplishes this

task, with the caveat that it is extremely important to recognize that frequent breaks for questions can interrupt the ﬂow of the narrative, making it fragmented

and interfering with comprehension if they are not extremely brief. It’s critical to return to the reading quickly.

To use this technique effectively, combine the frequency of questions with brevity. Ask quickly to ensure comprehension and **attention**, and then get right

back to reading. While you read, lots of short, focused discussion breaks max- imize comprehension in the moment. This isn’t to say that there’s no place for

broader and deeper conversations. They are merely different from what you ask to ensure that students grasp the full detail and depth of what they’re reading as

they are reading it. Here’s an example of what Don’t Wait might look like during a reading of

a short section from the ﬁrst chapter of Madeline L’Engle’s A Wrinkle in Time. The example is adapted from watching the lessons of several top teachers. I’ve

inserted the teacher’s questions in roman type within the text of the book, which I am assuming students would be reading aloud. If you’re not familiar with A

Wrinkle in Time, the passage occurs just after the protagonist, Meg Murry, has ****Comprehension**** 291

come down from her bedroom in a state of anxiety and fear in the middle of a dark and stormy night. She ﬁnds her little brother, Charles Wallace, waiting there.

In the kitchen a light was already on, and Charles Wallace was sitting at the table drinking milk and eating bread and jam. He looked very small and vulnerable

sitting there alone in the big old-fashioned kitchen, a blond little boy in faded blue Dr. Denton’s, his feet swinging a good six inches above the ﬂoor.

‘‘Hi,’’ he said cheerfully. ‘‘I’ve been waiting for you.’’ ****Teacher****: Is Meg’s brother younger or older than she is? What does it tell you

about him that he says he’s been ‘‘waiting for her’’? From under the table where he was lying at Charles Wallace’s feet, hoping

for a crumb or two, Fortinbras raised his slender dark head in greeting to Meg and his tail thumped against the ﬂoor. Fortinbras had arrived on their doorstep,

a half-grown puppy, scrawny and abandoned, one winter night. He was, Meg’s father had decided, part Llewellyn setter and part greyhound, and he had a

slender, dark beauty that was all his own. ‘‘Why didn’t you come up to the attic?’’ Meg asked her brother, speaking

as though he were at least her own age. ‘‘I’ve been scared stiff.’’ ‘‘Too windy up in that attic of yours,’’ the little boy said. ‘‘I knew you’d be

down. I put some milk on the stove for you. It ought to be hot by now.’’ ****Teacher****: Who’s calmer right now, Meg or her little brother?

How did Charles Wallace always know about her? How could he always tell? He never knew—or seemed to care—what Dennys or Sandy were thinking. It

was his mother’s mind, and Meg’s, that he probed with a frightening accuracy. ****Teacher****: Who is ‘‘he’’ in that sentence? [After correct identiﬁcation of

Charles Wallace as ‘‘he’’:] What does it mean that Charles Wallace probed their minds with frightening accuracy?

Was it because people were a little afraid of him that they whispered about the Murry’s youngest child, who was rumored to be not quite bright?

‘‘I’ve heard that clever people often have subnormal children,’’ Meg had once overheard. ‘‘The two boys seem to be nice, regular children, but that unattractive

girl and the baby boy certainly aren’t all there.’’ ****Teacher****: What do people mean when they say Meg and Charles ‘‘aren’t all

there’’? Are they ‘‘subnormal’’? One question you might ask, after reviewing the preceding sequence, is how

do I balance Don’t Wait with other methods of developing reading skills from previous chapters, such as Fluency or Control the Game? Although this sequence

could be integrated with such approaches as is, it could also be coordinated via two separate readings. That is, you might have students read once for ﬂuency

and then read a second time with questions embedded. Teach Like a Champion

Lower the Level Questions about a text can refer to any of (at least) four levels

of meaning: •

Word or phrase level of meaning: “What does the word forlorn mean here? Why might the author have chosen that word?” “The author says, ‘It was

the worst thing imaginable.’ What’s the ‘it’ she’s referring to there?” “What does it mean that Aslan ‘turned on’ the witch? What else beyond just turning

around?” •

Sentence level of meaning: “Can you take that sentence and put it in simpler language?” “How might we express an idea like that today?”

• Passage level of meaning: “What part of this paragraph tells you that Mohi is

mean spirited?” •

Story level of meaning: “What’s the purpose of this essay?” It’s easy to assume that the goal is to get to the story level as quickly as pos-

sible and ask as great a proportion of story-level questions as possible. In fact, the lower levels of meaning (word and sentence) are critical to ensuring ﬁrm

story-level understanding. Misunderstandings about big issues often start as mis- understandings about smaller things: who “them” is in a sentence, for example.

Students will be more successful in story-level discussions when they have a ﬁrm grasp of sentence and word-level meaning. Remember to ask constantly about

the lower levels and ensure that meaning is built reliably up from small units to larger ones.

Here are the questions from the Wrinkle in Time transcript I included in Don’t Wait with each identiﬁed according to the level it focuses on. To be clear,

I would expect the teacher to ask more story and passage level questions after concluding the passage but only on the assumption that they are balanced by

plenty of word-phrase and sentence-level questions during (and even after) the reading.

Is Meg’s brother younger or older than she is? [Passage level] What does it tell you about him that he says he’s been “waiting for her”?

[Phrase level] Who’s calmer right now, Meg or her little brother? [Passage level]

Who is “he” in that sentence? [Word level] ****Comprehension**** 293

What does it mean that Charles Wallace probed their minds with frightening accuracy? [Phrase level]

What do people mean when they say Meg and Charles “aren’t all there”? [Phrase level]

Are Meg and Charles Wallace “subnormal”? [Passage level] Evidence-Based

Questioning Top reading teachers constantly emphasize

groundedness in the text, even on subjective and opinion questions, by asking evidence-based

questions—that is, questions where students must

make reference to a fact or event from the text. One of the primary advantages is

that evidence-based questions are “testable” in that you can much more clearly tell whether students have understood (or done) the reading. It’s easier to get

a line on how well (and even whether) a student grasped what she just read if a question pins her down to something concrete in the text. You can fake your

response to a question about a story’s theme by listening to the discussion and offering a vague summary in support. You can offer a judgment (“What did you

think was the most exciting scene, Sarah?”) with only the thinnest engagement in what you’ve read. But you can’t nearly as easily fake “What happened on

page 157?” “What words in the sentences tell you there’s trouble brewing?” “Find me the sentence that proves who took Carlton’s watch.”

It’s important to observe that evidence-based questions need not be narrow or concrete. You could just as easily ask students to ﬁnd a sentence or a passage

that supports the argument that a certain idea is the theme of a story. Further, evidence can be used in two ways: to induce and deduce. You could ask students

to ﬁnd three pieces of evidence that characters in Greek mythology are punished for doing things to excess or you could cite three examples of characters getting

punished for their excess and ask student to draw the relevant conclusion. To provide some examples, I’ve taken some of the questions from the

A Wrinkle in Time sequence in the sections above and revised them to show how they might be made more evidence based.

Original: Is Meg’s brother younger or older than she is? Revised: Who can read me a sentence from the text that shows that Meg’s

brother is younger than she is? Who can ﬁnd me more evidence, this time with an example that helps us guess his age.

Original: What does it tell you about him that he says he’s been “waiting for her”?

Teach Like a Champion Revised: Who can ﬁnd other examples of places where Charles Wallace

appears to know what Meg is thinking? Original: Who’s calmer right now, Meg or her little brother?

Revised: What details in this scene **help** show us that Charles Wallace is cooler and calmer than his sister? I’ll want you to ﬁnd the exact words.

Original: What does it mean that Charles Wallace probed their minds with frightening accuracy?

Revised: On the next page we’re going to see Mrs. Whatsit read Meg’s mind. What can you conclude about their relationship from these two strange

incidents? Postreading Techniques

A good experience with a text doesn’t end when the reading ends. Here are some observations about the types of questions champion teachers ask as they push

discussion onto broader or more analytical topics after completing a text (or a day’s reading).

Summarize Summarizing is especially important as a tool to process at the

end of a session of reading and is most effective when it forces students to prioritize information separating important from peripheral points and rephras-

ing and condensing key ideas to ensure that they “own” the material. When summarizing is unsuccessful it’s often because a teacher fails to stress the differ-

ence between retelling (rewriting or restating details) and summarizing (retelling while condensing and prioritizing the important parts). When teaching students

to summarize, ask questions like, “Who can describe the chapter by recapping its three most important events?” or “Can you summarize the author’s two major

arguments in support of his thesis?” These questions are powerful because they ask students to prioritize information. Until students fully understand the nuances

of effective summary, asking questions requiring speciﬁc elements of summary such as prioritization are often most effective as teaching tools.

Another particularly effective strategy is to provide students with an ever- decreasing word limit for their summaries (for example, “Summarize this chapter

in ﬁfty words. Now summarize the chapter in a single sentence with fewer than ﬁfteen words”). This always proves challenging: shortening accurately and effec-

tively is a lot harder than just shortening because it requires true comprehension and insight to prioritize information. There are, as far as I can tell, two ways to

****Comprehension**** 295 shorten a summary: reduce the number of topics you are trying to include and

reduce the number of words you use to describe the topics you include. These tips may **help** get students closer to efﬁcient and effective summaries:

• Ask students to go back through their initial summary and eliminate every

word that’s not absolutely necessary. As students get more proﬁcient at this skill, suggest that they eliminate adjectives and replace them with stronger,

more potent verbs, boiling “ran as quick as she could” down to “sprinted.” You can take this a step further by then suggesting words for them to eliminate (and

expanding their conception of how to drop verbiage) or having them suggest unnecessary verbiage in one another’s summaries.

• Ask students to prioritize the events in a summarized section. They will get

only so far in making tighter and tighter descriptions of all the events in a section but will ultimately have to choose to leave some out entirely. Rank-

ordering the events or material to be summarized forces that process along. (Discussing that order can be an effective conversation as well.) Jackie Robin-

son once said that a life is not important except in the impact it has on other lives. You can use the same criterion for deciding which events belong in a

summary: “An event is most important in the impact it has [or is likely to have] on other scenes in the story. If you know or think it will affect the outcome of

the book, include it in the summary; if not, drop it.”

# Better connections

When asking students to make connections beyond a text, champion teachers

recognize that certain types of questions are usually more rigorous (and more likely to reinforce reading comprehension) than others. The types of questions

are listed next in priority order according to their relative rigor, with the more rigorous question formats at the top (be aware that this order may be contrary to

what many teachers expect or assume): • Text-to-text. These are preferable to text-to-world and text-to-self because

they reinforce testable ideas rather than judgments, opinions, and stories that students may not be able to access (“That happened once to my mom!”). They can

include within-the-text questions (“When else in the book have we seen someone act this way?”) and across-text questions (“Can anyone think of a character in

another book we’ve read who was similar?” or “How is the suspense in this chapter like or unlike the suspense at the end of Fantastic Mr. Fox?”).

Teach Like a Champion • Text-to-world. Asking students to relate an issue in a story to some event

or person in their world is a valid exercise. This is so especially when it asks students to connect speciﬁc aspects of a text to speciﬁc aspects of the broader

world rather than allowing them to discuss any connection they see to any event in the world.

Some of the most common text-to-world connections are text-to-media con- nections in which students connect something in the text with television shows or

movies they have seen. Text-to-media connections can often take conversations about texts off track. It may be best to tell students that you are not looking for

text-to-media connections. However, assuming a student’s text-to-media connec- tion is a valid one, the best follow-up question is something like this: “How does

the connection you are making between our hero in the text and Spider Man **help** you to understand the text?” or “What speciﬁcally about Mr. Fox is similar to

Spider Man?” • Text-to-self. These questions are inevitable and valid, but they are also

more limited in their relevance to other students and comprehension of texts. Although engaging, they can often lead classes astray. They are best when they

focus on the speciﬁc elements of the text being read (“How would you feel if you were in a position like Donovan, Charles?”) rather than sweeping in their

breadth (“Did anyone else have a time when they felt scared?”). Keep in mind that connections are not an end in and of themselves. For

example, while reading a story about a birthday party, a student may say, “I went to my cousin’s birthday party last week.” It is important not to accept

this connection without further questioning: “What happened at your cousin’s birthday party that reminds you of this story?” or “What kinds of things happened

at your cousin’s birthday party that might also happen here?” Students should be encouraged to use their connection to develop an understanding of the text,

and to do that, you should bring the connection back to the text: “So how does that **help** us understand what’s happening here?”

****Teaching**** literary structures and conventions is especially productive in **help**- ing students make worthy connections. The basic idea is that conventions describe

the ways stories usually or often work: the degree to which a story conforms to or diverges from convention (what most stories do) is a deeply productive line

for connecting. But to do so, students need lots of study of other texts and the idea of structures and conventions. Point out that they can and should look for

connections to text, particularly text-to-text connections and connections based ****Comprehension**** 297

on structures, conventions, and methods. Ensuring a rich collection of shared books that the whole class or school has read is one good way to enable this.

# Standard-aligned questions

Most state standards articulate a dozen or so core types of questions students need

to be able to answer. If they don’t do so explicitly, the assessment portfolio your school uses (state tests, SATs, and whatever additional assessments you add) do it

implicitly. For example, New York essentially asks four types of character study questions: character change (“How did x change during the story?”), character

perspective (“Which of these statements would x probably agree with?”), char- acter motivation (Why did x decide to walk home from school?”), and character

traits (X could best be described as . . . ”). Although it’s easy for teachers to fall into the habit of asking the same

three or four types of questions over and over, their students need to practice the full array of question types, both to ensure their success on assessments

that stand between them and college (and college readiness) and to make sure they are comfortable demonstrating a wide range of skills. Discipline yourself

to ask questions that mirror the kinds of comprehension questions students need to master, thus providing practice at all skills and enforcing diversity on you

and your students. Top teachers are intentional about this in several ways, often making an inclusive list and mapping them into their unit plans so they are

constantly focusing on a different type of questions. They also study the different formats of questions used on assessments to better understand how the questions

are asked and ensure that their own questions are at least as rigorous as the questions that control access to college.

# ****Vocabulary**** and comprehension

In clip 25 on the DVD, Roberto de Leon of Excellence Charter ****School**** of

Bedford Stuyvesant demonstrates exemplary teaching of vocabulary and comprehension. He is preteaching vocabulary words that are critical to the

story. Notice that students get multiple opportunities to use and hear decoy Teach Like a Champion

in a variety of settings, including one that intentionally front-loads the story they are about to read, thus allowing them to apply their vocabulary to

explain and react to the book. De Leon is careful to differentiate between words that are the same and words that are similar. Contrasting the subtle

differences between words is at least as important as discussing their similarities.

# ****Reading**** strategies and the techniques

# Of champion teachers

In the Introduction to this book, I discussed the difference between techniques

and strategies. I recognize in drawing this distinction that many teachers of reading use what they refer to as “reading strategies” to guide their teaching.

These strategies draw from the work of several authors who propose similar conceptualizations of the strategies students need to achieve full comprehension.

They usually include a group of skills like the following: noticing, connecting, picturing, wondering, predicting, inferencing, and summarizing.

Given the prominence of strategies-based **instruction** in the professional dis- course of reading teachers, I’ll describe how the techniques here can overlap

and interface with common approaches to “reading strategies.” Although a vari- ety of authors write about reading strategies, I will use Nancy Boyles’s book,

Constructing Meaning Through Kid-Friendly ****Comprehension**** ****Strategy**** ****Instruction**** (2004), for this discussion because it is among the clearest and most effective.

In the analysis here, I am frankly critical of some aspects of strategies instruc- tion and the manner in which it can be employed. Therefore I want to make it

clear that I believe that well-implemented, strategies-based reading **instruction** can be effective and that the work of authors like Boyles has advanced the qual-

ity of the teaching of reading. At the same time, a series of signiﬁcant pitfalls can erode its effectiveness, and a wide disparity exists in effectiveness among the

strategies. With that in mind, I make some general observations about strategies and then look at each of the most common strategies individually.

Risks and Challenges of Strategies ****Instruction**** Relying heavily on reading strategies poses risks and challenges. One challenge

is that the “strategies” involved are often too broadly deﬁned. The strategy ****Comprehension**** 299

“noticing,” which Boyles deﬁnes as “keying-in to important verbal clues: words, sentences, and paragraphs that offer evidence of the text’s meaning” (p. 10),

is an example. By that deﬁnition, what comment about a text, even one only tangentially related to it, would not be an example of noticing? And because

nearly every response to a book requires an act of noticing something, teachers risk reinforcing the idea that any observation is worthwhile or that all observa-

tions are equally productive. However, all comments can’t be equally useful, so the necessary and often unresolved question quickly becomes, How can teachers

identify and **help** students understand the things that are most worthy of notice, and how can they systematically be identiﬁed and modeled?

A second challenge in strategies-based reading **instruction** is a confusion of correlation and cause. This is reﬂected in the basic argument behind strategies-

based **instruction**: that if good readers do x, then those who do x will become good readers. Good readers may picture what they are reading in their minds

as they read it, but this may well be an effect rather than a cause of good reading. Is this really a signiﬁcant issue? Surely a study of proﬁcient readers

could reveal that strong readers all like to sit in comfortable chairs when they read. If this were the case, there would be a strong correlation between com-

fort and reading. But if we assumed a causal relationship (as strategies theory sometimes advises), we would likely approach reading by making the seating of

students in more comfortable chairs a major priority, which would clearly be a mistake (and an expensive one at that!). Similarly, it’s a larger logical leap than

it may appear to suggest that practicing picturing will make you a better reader. In fact two examples Boyles provides suggest how tenuous this assumption

is. In the ﬁrst example, Boyles writes: To **help** students understand the value of using the picturing strategy while

reading, I ask them to remember a time when they received big news, whether it was good news or bad news. ‘‘Where were you when you got the news?’’

I ask. ‘‘What was the weather like at the time? Who was with you?’’ Chances are you can answer all of these questions. The **content** of that message, the big

news you received, is forever embedded in the context in which you received the news, a context that is made of many different sensory impressions. [p. 8]

Ironically, Boyles’s example may prove only that students already have the capacity to picture. She assumes that if she asks them to recall an intense memory,

they will have a strong visual memory of it. The problem, then, may not be that the students don’t know how to picture. It may be that if they understand

what they read and have excess processing capacity left over after ﬁguring out Teach Like a Champion

the words and the basic fact of the description, they will picture it naturally. That, Boyles appears to assume, is what their minds naturally do. In that case,

teaching them to read ﬂuently and attend carefully to mundane details might be more effective than investing time in intentionally “teaching” them to picture,

something they appear to know how to do. They just need a clear sense of what to picture.

In a similar example, Boyles writes: ‘‘Readers ﬁgure out different kinds of things as they read,’’ I tell my students,

holding up the ‘‘ﬁguring out’’ mini-poster . . . . ‘‘For example, the author might write that a certain character calls people names and teases kids who are younger,

and this character picks ﬁghts, too. The author wants us to ﬁgure out that this kid is a . . . How would you ﬁll in that blank?’’ I ask my students.

‘‘Bully!’’ everyone choruses. ‘‘He’s a bully.’’ [p. 12] The fact that Boyles assumes that her students already have the capacity to

ﬁgure out a story before she’s taught them strategies (as long as the basic narrative is presented to them as simple, clear formulation) suggests that the problem may

not be in their capacity to ﬁgure out but in their capacity to understand enough of the details of the story to engage their “ﬁguring-out” skills fully. In short, good

readers may “ﬁgure out,” but the problem for bad readers may not be that they don’t know how to ﬁgure out but rather that they don’t understand what they’ve

read enough to use those skills. Another challenge to strategies **instruction**, a challenge to which the tech-

niques in this book are not immune, is that the easier a strategy is to understand and use, the more likely teachers may be to use it. However, something easier

to use is not necessarily more conducive to student achievement. Connecting, picturing, and predicting are especially tangible and speciﬁc. Their clarity may

tacitly encourage teachers to use them more often. This may not be justiﬁed, however, because they have signiﬁcant downsides, which are discussed later in

this section, particularly in regards to “picturing,” a technique easily overused and therefore particularly distracting.

In addition, reading strategies can be used to promote both engagement and comprehension, which are different goals, and teachers sometimes do not recog-

nize the difference between the two. Boyles writes, “If we try really hard to think of ways a story connects to us and our lives . . . we’re more likely to stick with

the story. That’s one reason it’s so important to look for connections. Making connections with the text will **help** us to keep reading it” (p. 7). Although it’s

certainly worthwhile to try to engage students in texts so they want to read them, it’s also important to note that making students want to read a book and ensuring

****Comprehension**** 301 that they comprehend it are different issues. Picturing what they’re reading may

engage students and cause them to persist in reading, but this is a different issue from whether they understand what they are reading. For all you know, the pic-

ture they’ve made in their minds is erroneous! Strategies-based **instruction** can frequently fail to make this distinction.

Finally, there is a large caveat regarding ﬂuency that generally does not get fully acknowledged in discussions of strategies **instruction**. Boyles writes,

“****Teaching**** reading comprehension strategies can beneﬁt just about any student operating at a reasonable level of reading ﬂuency (second grade or above)”

(p. xiv). It’s worth noting that many students in high-poverty schools aren’t at that level, and Boyles’s assertion that a second-grade level of ﬂuency is the

cut-off point for determining the efﬁcacy of strategies **instruction** appears to be arbitrary. What if it’s ﬁfth grade? What if it’s “sufﬁcient to the level of the book

you’re trying to read” and the book is hard? With any technique, the question we should ask is not whether its use can **help** students learn to read but whether it

can **help** students learn to read better and more efﬁciently than reading. Whether this is the case with strategies **instruction** remains an unanswered question. It is

almost assuredly the case in some instances and assuredly not the case in others. The unintended consequence of any teaching approach is the tendency to

make the approach (not comprehension) the purpose. For example, a student makes a useful comment, but the teacher says: “You’re not visualizing! I asked

you to visualize.” This risk is especially acute in strategies-based **instruction** because the strategies are actions students are supposed to enact, and this public

aspect means there’s an incentive to misapply the approach more aggressively and broadly.

This is equally true with the techniques in this book. Ben Marcovitz, principal of the successful Sci Academy Charter ****School**** in New Orleans, described how

to think about this paradox in a panel presentation: “My teachers are accountable for results. The techniques can get them there. They have for others. But the

point is to succeed—not to use the techniques no matter what. If they can ﬁnd some other way to get great results, I don’t have a problem with that.”

# Specific strategies and their relationship

# To the techniques in this book

In this section, I discuss each of several common reading strategies and ana-

lyze both areas of concern and their connection to the techniques described in this book.

Teach Like a Champion Noticing

In further describing the strategy of noticing, Boyles writes, “When we ﬁnd clues in the text, we should ﬁle them away carefully in our mind so we can pull them

out later and see how they all ﬁt together—as main ideas and themes” (p. 11). While noticing things is critical to becoming an effective reader, it is

far too broadly and vaguely deﬁned to be useful as a tool for teaching. What comment, observation, or moment of engaged **attention** would not be

an example of noticing something about a text? Since every response to a book requires an act of noticing something, teachers risk reinforcing that any

observation is worthwhile or that all observations are equally productive. Or they risk telling students to notice without giving them useful guidance on what

to notice. The question is: What are the things students should notice most, and how can they systematically be identiﬁed and modeled?

One place where the techniques I’ve described in this section can be espe- cially useful is in helping students to notice better. What **kind** of observations

can students make to use their noticing in the most productive way? •

Observations that relate to and advance understanding of the most impor- tant ideas in what you are reading. This sounds obvious but can be greatly

improved with a bit of discipline and advanced planning. Use focal points, for example, to draw students’ **attention** to some critical themes or ideas in what

you’re reading and ask them to try to notice, as they are reading, the things that make Macbeth’s ambition destroy him or that allow Charlotte’s goodness

to change and Wilbur to mature. In short, don’t just have students read; have them read for something. Alternatively, and especially if you prefer a style

that’s less proscriptive about what the most important themes might be, use front-loading to draw students’ **attention** to scenes of special importance so

that you can discuss critical watershed moments in special depth. •

Observations that relate to and advance understanding of skills (that is, learning standards) you’re teaching at the time. Using standards-aligned

questioning is especially effective to develop students’ skills at noticing a wide variety of powerful things about a text. If you are studying characteriza-

tion, for example, ask them to notice how the characters are changing, or are described, or speak. Many students are most inclined to notice in the ways that

are most natural and intuitive for them. Asking them to employ speciﬁc skills in noticing forces them out of their comfort zones and builds their ability to

notice in a wider variety of ways. ****Comprehension**** 303

• Evidence-based observations. Noticing the evidence that supports the opinion

is as important as the opinion itself, or even more important, “What makes you mistrust him?” is usually a better question than, “Do you trust the main

character?” Use evidence-based questioning to stress this aspect of noticing. •

Observations drawing on different levels of noticing. The thing about not noticing is secondary ignorance. By its deﬁnition, you don’t usually know

that you didn’t notice something. A lower-level technique can cause students to notice more systematically by stressing and causing them to practice dif-

ferent types of things to notice about a text. Observing what a tricky phrase means or how an author cleverly crafted a sentence to make the subject of the

action unclear is often just as important as noticing that the main character is probably untrustworthy. Certainly students need to practice noticing at all of

these levels. Ask them; then try to notice things about the colloquial phrases an author uses; her word choice; or how she likes to start or ﬁnish her chapters;

or, ideally, how her word choice and use of phrases show that she’s trying to do something particular with the beginning of chapters.

Connecting When connecting (or making connections) students are socialized to think of

ways the text they are reading is similar to some previous or familiar experience. Readers can connect with another text (a text-to-text connection), the world (a

text-to-world connection), or themselves (a text-to-self connection). One of the beneﬁts Boyles describes of connecting is that it engages students in the text. “If

we try really hard to think of ways a story connects to us and our lives . . . we’re more likely to stick with the story” (p. 7). This is certainly true and signiﬁcant,

though it’s also worth observing that while getting students to engage is an important and worthy goal, it is a different goal from their comprehending.

Thoughtful connections can often be the jumping-off

place for inferences about the text. They can **help** students

begin to understand the text by tapping into what they

already know about a topic. Thoughtful connections can often

be the jumping-off place for inferences about the text. They can **help** students

begin to understand the text by tap- ping into what they already know about

a topic. Effective connections can also **help** students see the story from a char-

acter’s point of view by accessing their own analogous experience. But they

don’t necessarily do this, and in many Teach Like a Champion

cases, the connections students are most likely to make (“Hey, this is just like something that happened to my family!”) are least rigorous and least useful

to engendering long-term reading comprehension. (“Hey, this is just like the introduction to the other book we read,” is probably a more useful connection

in the long term than is a text-to-self connection.) Furthermore, students (or teachers) can infer that the point is simply to make any **kind** of connection

to the text. That shouldn’t be the end. Connections aren’t inherently valuable; only good connections are. A good connection serves to **help** readers under-

stand something about the text, not the thing connected to—in most cases, having the discipline to use the world to understand the text rather than the

text to understand the world. Students can also potentially let their connection project onto the text. That is, they can replace actual details with imagined

details or contradictory or confusing details as when a student who once lost an article of clothing and was upset about it infers that a character who lost her

sweater was also upset, even while the text has clues showing that the character was happy about it. Finally, connections can be off task and waste time, and

clever students can use them to co-opt discussion onto easier or more convenient topics.

It may also be that people naturally make connections, and so the skill doesn’t need to be taught so much as managed and guided. The skill is in making

connections effective and focused. In light of that, you should be clear about linking connections back to the text to understand what light the connection

sheds on what you’re reading. These and other aspects of making effective connections are discussed in the

Better Connections section above. Picturing

In picturing, Boyles writes, students are taught to use clues from the text to create an image of what is described. This helps students remember what they’ve read

and engage in the text. “The pictures we have in our mind **help** us respond to the text at an emotional level” (p. 8), Boyles writes, and this is almost certainly true.

Generally, however, picturing is among the most overused and poorly used strategies, and this is signiﬁcant because it can be among the most destructive in

its application. The use of picturing as a comprehension strategy may be confused by some teachers as validating visual literacy generally and make it more common

for them to use visual images more frequently to aid in comprehension. This may seem benign, but the result is a compensatory strategy for effective reading. In

****Comprehension**** 305 teaching students to picture, some teachers feel encouraged to draw on actual

pictures to make inferences about the story in a way that crowds out reading. When a teacher says, “What do you think is about to happen? Look at the picture

if you need **help**!” she is allowing students to “read” the story by drawing enough information from pictures to keep them from having to read the words to succeed.

This results in their learning to circumvent their poor reading skills. Teachers may also overuse the picturing strategy because it is so accessible.

As a result, they may spend valuable time visualizing rather than reading or asking more productive and rigorous questions. Teachers often make it a point

to take a simple passage from a book and ask students to visualize it so they understand it. “ ‘He went to his desk, opened the drawer and pulled out a marker.’

Class let’s try to visualize what that looked like. What was in the drawer? How did he walk across the room?” This can be useful. But it’s also worth noting that

this could be a scene where the author didn’t think it was important to create a sensory image. More important, picturing can be incorrect. Students who are

asked to picture an image can and often do introduce erroneous details. In this example, the student might create a false image of when and why the character

went to the drawer and what he found there. Finally, it’s also possible that intentionally visualizing doesn’t **help** students

learn to comprehend what they read that much. As Boyles points out in her book, people seem to naturally visualize when they understand something, so we could

ask whether picturing is a strategy the causes comprehension or is the result of it, with better picturing resulting from better comprehension.

The most productive application of visualizing is

when a teacher asks students to draw or picture a scene in

order to clear up what’s confusing about it.

The most productive applications of visualizing I’ve seen teachers use are

to ask students to draw or picture a scene in order to clear up what’s con-

fusing about it. For example, a teacher I observed teaching Macbeth drew sepa-

rate pictures of Birnam Wood and Dunsi- nane and then sketched how soldiers cut

down the branches and marched to the latter location, thus proving the impos-

sible prophecy of Macbeth’s dream true. This is different from asking students to share what they are visualizing. Another effective use of visualizing is to ask

students to create a picture using details they have read in the book. This is actually a version of an evidence-based question, and when teachers do it well,

Teach Like a Champion they ask students to point out speciﬁc aspects of the story and or where they

found certain details that gave them their picture. Wondering

In wondering, students ask questions of the text as they read. Examples, Boyles writes, might include wondering “what might happen next in the story or how

the story might end” (p. 9). This technique is also sometimes called “asking questions.” As with noticing, however, the technique is at times vague. Wonder

about what? Anything? All things equally? Having students develop questions about what they are reading encourages them to be active readers and may moti-

vate them to know more about a text. Moreover, wonderment and curiosity are usually very good things. The point is that there are myriad forms of wondering,

and they aren’t all inherently of equal value. Students’ private experience, in which what they want to wonder about is their own to determine, and public

experience, in which a group of people chooses certain wonderings to discuss, are different kettles of ﬁsh. There are settings for both, and in the latter, a class

deserves criteria about what wonderings they’ll engage most. “Here are the kinds of things we’re going to talk and wonder about today to increase our understand-

ing of the story [or our skills at understanding stories].” I realize this may seem either vague or directive (Is he telling us to shut down kids’ imaginations? some

readers may ask), but encouraging students to wonder on the premise that it is inherently among the most valuable things they could be doing regardless of how

and what they wonder about is a false premise. Wondering can be especially effective when modeled by a teacher, especially

in a soliloquy form. “I’m wondering, here, what might make Donald want to give his dog away. I’m thinking back to the earlier chapters, and I know Donald loves

his dog. The author told us he would ‘never do anything to hurt him.’ So I’m wondering: Why might a boy give away a dog he loves?” While this strategy of

making thoughts visible can model how to think about books effectively, it can also result in teachers’ doing most of the work. Rather than involving students

and working to transfer thinking skills to students, they are merely performing a public literary analysis.

Predicting Boyles writes that “predicting sets the stage for students to monitor their own

understanding of the text” (p. 10). In its most basic and common form, it involves teachers asking students what they think is going to happen next. Its beneﬁts

include engagement. It gets students to focus on what they are reading next to ****Comprehension**** 307

see if their prediction is conﬁrmed. When done well, it can also **help** them mon- itor their understanding of the text based on whether their predictions came true.

That’s the best possible outcome of predicting, but to make that effective, you should make a habit of circling back to intentionally discuss whether predic-

tions came true and why. This last step makes predicting a relatively productive activity, but unfortunately, the last step often doesn’t happen, perhaps because

many teachers don’t recognize the particular value of this aspect of predicting. You can augment the strength of your predicting if you use the evidence-based

questioning technique. This will cause you to consistently ask more productive questions. In the immediate follow-up to each prediction, you can ask: “Why do

you think will happen next?” and “What in the text makes that seem likely to happen?” In the postprediction follow-up you can ask: “Why did you think so?”

“What fooled you?” and “What made you know this would happen?” Two other challenges pose barriers to predicting and can often make it an

ineffective use of time. First, students can make wild predictions unrelated to the text or more related to their lives or experiences than to the text. Alternatively

they can narrate the obvious and make predicting facile. The best defense against this is once again to focus on evidence-based questioning. This forces students

to ground their predictions in the text. Figuring Out and Inferring

Stop and ask a student to reread a line, unpack a key

phrase, deﬁne a word, underline a crucial piece of

evidence. The

last strategy

common to

most reading teachers is alternatively called

ﬁguring out or inferring. Boyles refers to ﬁguring out as pushing students to

go “beyond the construction of basic meaning to a deeper understanding of

the text” (p. 12). This strategy attempts to focus on what is by all rights the

heavy hitter of comprehension: under- standing what’s between the lines, left unsaid, hinted at. In short, this is the

strategy that asks students to go beyond the basic, literal understanding of the text to apply higher-order thinking. But its importance belies the difﬁculty

of applying it. Obviously, merely asking a student to make an inference won’t do. You can’t tell a student, “Read this page and ﬁgure something out that you

can share with the class.” Inference happens but can’t be commanded. To make inference successful you must set the table, often by meticulous

work with both the Lower Your Level and Don’t Wait techniques. When your Teach Like a Champion

students are learning to make inferences, you can surreptitiously assemble the key pieces they need to make their leap forward by stopping frequently with

short discussions of and directives to attend to the key pieces of guidance in the pages or lines before. Stop and ask a student to reread a line, unpack a key

phrase, deﬁne a word, underline a crucial piece of evidence. ****Focus**** on words and phrases; the building blocks that make or break the inference often start at

the mundane level. Ironically, strong **instruction** on the literal meaning of the text, including vocabulary and focus on important details, doesn’t distract from

higher-order thinking. It makes it possible. Summarizing

Advocates of strategies-based **instruction** sometimes also include summarizing as a key strategy. For this strategy I see nearly 100 percent overlap with the

techniques in this book. For a further discussion, see 100 Percent (technique 36 in Chapter Six).

# Conclusion

# The end is the Beginning

In the Introduction to this book, I addressed the differences between techniques

and strategies. A strategy, you may recall, is a decision, and a technique is something you practice, hone, and adapt throughout your life. Artists, athletes,

musicians, surgeons, and performers of a thousand other varieties achieve great- ness only by their **attention** to the details of their technique. Their constant

reﬁnement of it perpetually renews their passion for the craft and allows them to seek the grail of better performance, expression that sings, the ability to make the

greatest possible difference. This focus on technique and its constant reﬁnement is also the path to excellence for teachers.

Approaching teaching as an art—meaning by that phrase that it is difﬁcult and requires ﬁnesse and discretion in the application, craftsmanship, and careful

and attentive development of technique to master it—is the path to success. That path is different for each teacher. The techniques developed by champion

teachers and described in this book were not mine to start with, but they can belong to any teacher who embraces the concept of constant attentive reﬁnement

of techniques. Only that approach, coupled with the aggregated wisdom of the teachers compiled in this book, will be sufﬁcient to change the equation of

opportunity in our schools and close the achievement gap at scale. Adapted, reﬁned, improved, and, perhaps in a few cases, ignored because not everything

in this book can be right for you, these techniques can transform your classroom. A colleague of mine, Ben Markovitz, recently founded a new school in New

Orleans. Sci Academy achieved exemplary ﬁrst-year results with high school students who had not previously been successful. This school has made extensive

Conclusion and focused use of the techniques in this book, with dozens of staff meetings and

training sessions. Yet when Ben was recently asked how he ensures that his teachers use this material, he observed that he doesn’t. He manages his teachers

for results and provides these techniques to get them there. They are free to use them or not. All of them do, with an energy and vigor I am humbled by, but

Ben insists that the tools here are a means to results, not an end in themselves. I wholeheartedly agree with Ben. In fact, I would like this fact to distinguish

this book from so many others: it starts with and is justiﬁed by the results it helps teachers achieve, not by its fealty to some ideological principle. The result

to aim for is not the loyal adaptation of these techniques for their own sake but their application in the service of increased student achievement. Too many

ideas, even good ones, go bad when they become an end and not a means. The techniques I’ve written about were derived from observing outstanding

teachers at work. But more exciting than that fact is that way this book has changed over the years as I have been writing it. During that time, it has evolved

from an informal document within Uncommon Schools to a more explicit guide to **instruction** that I have shared with colleagues and offered trainings on, to this

book you’ve now read. It has changed and evolved and gained the depth that I hope has made it worthy of your time. What gives this book its depth and focus

is the unrelenting application of the ideas by remarkable teachers. What I ﬁrst wrote was a skeleton of what now appears; the techniques that appeared in it

were described in insufﬁcient terms and short aspirational paragraphs. Only when other teachers tried them, applied them, adapted them, and improved them (and

let me videotape them doing it) did the truly useful parts of this book emerge. In short, what’s good here is good only because of the process of constantly reﬁning

and adapting techniques in the relentless and restless drive for excellence. That observation seems a ﬁtting one with which to end.
