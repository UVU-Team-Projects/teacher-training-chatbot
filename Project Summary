Project Summary: Utah Elementary Teacher Training Assistant (UTAH-TTA)
The Utah Elementary Teacher Training Assistant (UTAH-TTA) is an innovative, LLM-powered educational chatbot developed to support the training of elementary school teachers in Utah, with a specific focus on second-grade instruction. This intelligent assistant simulates authentic classroom scenarios and provides personalized teaching guidance aligned with Utah Core Standards for second grade.

UTAH-TTA is designed to address the growing need for scalable, interactive professional development tools that help teachers master curriculum delivery, classroom management, and differentiated instruction strategies for 7-8 year olds. Through integration of expert-validated content and AI-driven scenario handling, the chatbot assists educators in navigating everyday teaching challenges and refining their pedagogical approaches.

Key features of the system include:

A robust knowledge base structured around second-grade core subjects (Math, ELA, Science, and Social Studies)

Age-appropriate classroom management techniques and teacher-student interactions

Scenario-based learning modules reflecting real-life classroom conditions

A Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) pipeline for generating context-aware, standard-aligned responses

An intuitive web interface for ease of use by educators

The projectâ€™s development followed an agile workflow with clearly defined roles across AI/ML, frontend, backend, data engineering, and documentation. Content validation is conducted in partnership with Dr. Krista Ruggles, an expert in Elementary Education STEM at Utah Valley University.

With plans for future enhancements such as multilingual support, adaptive learning paths, gamification, and LMS integration, UTAH-TTA aims to become a transformative tool in teacher training and support across Utah's elementary education system.
