## Code Snippets

### Model Setup Example
```python
from llama_cpp import Llama

# Initialize model
llm = Llama(
    model_path="models/llama-2-7b-chat.gguf",
    n_ctx=2048,
    n_threads=4,
    n_gpu_layers=0
)

# Example usage
def get_completion(prompt):
    # Add your completion code here
    pass
```

### Prompt Template Example
```python
def generate_response(scenario, personality="helpful", tone="professional"):
    prompt = f"""<s>[INST]You are a teacher with a {personality} personality.
    Respond to this student scenario in a {tone} tone:
    
    {scenario}[/INST]"""
    
    # Add your generation code here
    pass
```
