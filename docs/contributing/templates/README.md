# How to Use Templates - A Student Guide

Welcome! This guide will help you understand how to use our project templates. Don't worry if you're new to this - we'll explain everything step by step.

## üéØ What are Templates and Why Do We Use Them?

Templates are pre-made forms that help us keep information organized and consistent. Think of them like fill-in-the-blank worksheets that make sure we don't forget important details.

## üìù Available Templates

### 1. Pull Request Template
**When to use:** Every time you want to submit your code changes to the project.

Think of this like turning in homework:
- You need to explain what you did
- Show that you tested it
- Make sure it follows the class rules
- Ask for feedback from others

[See Pull Request Example ‚Üí](examples/pull-request-example.md)

### 2. Bug Report Template
**When to use:** When you find something that's not working correctly.

Like reporting a problem in a video game:
- Describe what's broken
- Show how to make the problem happen
- Explain what should happen instead
- Include any error messages you see

[See Bug Report Example ‚Üí](examples/bug-report-example.md)

### 3. Feature Request Template
**When to use:** When you have an idea for something new to add to the project.

Similar to suggesting a new feature for your favorite app:
- Describe your idea
- Explain why it's useful
- Consider how it affects other features
- Think about how hard it might be to build

[See Feature Request Example ‚Üí](examples/feature-request-example.md)
